It's weird to know that I'll have to actually wait for a week to listen to your stuff.  Discovered THoR after it was all done, but listened to every episode at least 3 or 4 times.  I've been around the interwebz block, and your podcasts are the Gold Standard.  Beyond thrilled that you're back.

Hi Mike. I am a big fan of THoR podcast. I love your work and am glad you are doing another podcast. However, I've got some constructive criticism for Revolutions. I'm not entirely sure why, but with THoR podcast I never asked, 'why am I listening to this?' Maybe it's because it had a beginning, middle and an end. However, with Revolutions, because we're being dropped into a time period with so much background, halfway through 002 I found my self asking 'Why am I listening to this?' - not because the content wasn't interesting or well presented, but because I didn't know what I should be taking away from the English Civil War, or even why it is important. I'm sure I'll know these things by the end of the podcasts, but in your next Revolution series, maybe you could talk a little about why you selected that Revolution and why it was important just to set the context a little better. pls don't take this the wrong way, I *really* enjoy listening to your work. :-)

Hey Mike, very glad you are back after your awesome Rome podcast.

I really like the idea of the new podcast. Here comes the but. I know the English Civil war maybe a good part of the podcast, but it's not a good start. At least in my case (german) I know nothing about it. It's all new and very confusing.

Maybe it would have been better to start with something more common known like the Russian Revolution or the French Revolution. Then, when the listener is hooked, go deeper into history. Show why they are also as important as the ones before.

The History of Rome podcast started with legends and historical background and then presented us with protagonists and their follow ups. We got to hear about the milestones in relation to what we already heard before. This is important.

I'm guessing you're chronicling the age of popular revolutions that began with the proliferation of gunpowder weapons (1568~). If so – though probably if not so, as well – I'm excited!

You've definitely found a topic weighty enough to match your last one. Nevertheless, I wonder if you'll be able to craft a coherent narrative of it, as you did with the Rome podcast.

Huza mike I think we all can presume you'll be covering revolutions thanks for the picture and answering my question on jordan harbours twilight histories just wondering how far in history are you going to go with these podcasts. At any rate its nice to hear your voice again :D

A year later I'm still relistening to old episodes, so I happened to catch this.

No idea how reddit works but I'll try to be there. Anyone notice it's all English and Mexican revolutions, and not, say, American or Russian? No complaints here: I'd love to hear Mike's version of those events.

I started listening to THoR when it had already ended and after binge listening through the entire show I have to admit I was hooked. I actually envied the folks who got to listen to it as it developed. Actually in Italy right now and happened to check the podcast page by pure chance. Off to Rome in a few days to see the sights Mike talked about. Excited that you're coming back soon!

Mike, I forgot the best thing going. Go to the West Side Farmers Market. It's in the DMV parking lot over there. Dianne at Dream farm has the best goats milk cheeses (aged gouda is devine), Bruce at Edelweiss Creamery had a cave aged English Cheddar that is so buttery it melts in your mouth, and Mike & Cassie at Primrose are great with good vegetable selection. Stellas also has a stand there for their hot spicy cheese bread. It has just about everything of the one around the Capitol bit less crowded and you can park right next to the stalls.

I feel I must plead for the Irish revolution to be included in your upcoming Revolutionary Podcast Series.
800 years of foreign rule, to me, justifies the Irish independence as one of the most fascinating revolutionary movements in the 2nd millennium. The Easter Risings! Great stuff, dude. Great stuff. Would love to hear more about it.

So excited !! For me, the social upheavals, ideas of 'morality', and sociopolitical intrigue of the growing roman republic were the most compelling parts of the THoR podcast.

I'm so glad to see the Haitian revolution included, it's an important yet often forgotten story for Americans - from the benefits for major American land expansion as well as its role in racial politics. I recently spent a half year working in northern Haiti and I got to spend some time exploring the overgrown ruins of castles and forts built and stockpiled all over the north, some over a century after independence, in fear the french would return for retribution. The stripped and bare countryside around these ruins suggests that economic retribution was the real threat. I found the country's revolutionary history both inspiring and deeply tragic and I'm happy to hear your take!

Looking forward to what's coming, and also to re-listening to the entire Rome story. PS----->And a suggestion: turn that pic of those books 90 degrees LEFT, so we can read the titles without straining our necks. Thnx.

Mike,
Recall during a Roman triumph there was a man who held the laurels for the victorious general and whose job was to say in his ear "Although the people are cheering for you and treating you like a god, remember you are just a man." Well I'm going to be that guy. Be careful - you probably won't receive the same rave reviews as THoR, because this isn’t ancient history anymore. The chances of Julius Caesar posting a comment on your blog are, well, remote but Fidel Castro is still alive (albeit barely) and Pol Pot’s henchmen are awaiting trial.

And as a resident of Madison from 1987 to 1995, I know that Revolution has a special place in that community. Trouble is a sizable percentage of the population will take umbrage if your views wander off the reservation (see: Sterling Hall, August 1970). Don’t be mistaking white, land-owning men acting out the ideals of the Enlightenment with the genocidal capitalist oppressors they really were or you will be forced to move to Appleton.

Then you have the marketing. A Roman holiday sipping wine and looking at Nero’s villa sounds delightful. A field trip to Damascus, not so much. Still, revolution and tee shirt sales are always a winner.

Soundtrack recommendation – has to be The Clash, but which one – White Riot, I Fought the Law (and the Law won), Tommy Gun, Spanish Bombs, Washington Bullets? Probably Tommy Gun with that drum intro.

I will be listening and cheering you on. ¡Viva la Revolución! ¡Viva El Supremissimo Duncan!

"Revolutions" sounds fantastic, and a great way for Mike to delve into a new series that can still keep him fresh as he moves from one revolution to another.

I spent almost all of my final year of modern history in high school studying the Russian, Chinese and Cuban revolutions, so I'm looking forward to these three and the others that I know far less about. A major aspect of my study on China and Cuba was comparing the major issues (e.g. role of leadership, role of ideology, role of the masses etc) across both revolutions. I assume (and hope) that comparisons of the various revolutions will form an integral part of this series.

Great news! I'm still listening to old episodes, while watching "I Claudius" being rebroadcast by the BBC as well as the BBC's "History of the Dark Ages" (Huns, Vandals and Goths), and "Mothers, Murderers, Mistresses" (consorts of the emperors)

I am STILL planning to join a History of Rome tour as soon as finances allow. Please tell me you are still running one in 2014?

I'm still only partway through THoR - on the year of the four emperors.  Sorry that you had to drop the Masters degree, but best wishes for your new home (I still think of Texas as your new home, because I'm 3-4 years behind events in the podcast).  If you ever get to visit the Aldo Leopold Nature Centre, I'll be very jealous.

Also, great to hear about the new series.

Glad to hear that you're getting back to podcasting sooner than later -- I've love THoR since I discovered it a few months ago.

I'm finally listening to the interview on podcast squared and I'm going to disagree with one thing -- I love it when you're willing to share little bits of your life.  Maybe it's because I'm not a guy, but.... I don't want a dry lecture.  I want to imagine that we're sitting down in a pub having a great conversation about history (I talk back to your podcasts all the time -- can you hear me? :-).  And so, learning a bit about you, really sets the ambiance for that.

Hallo Mike, I never post online, but I have to post to express my unending gratitude for creating the HofR podcast. Im only up to the reign of Augustus, but I feel like I'm living in the Roman world when I listen. Thanks for the down to earth tongue in cheek approach you've taken. I heard someone say last week that the advantage of podcasting is that the pictures are created by the listener... never truer than in this case. Thanks, a listener from Gaul.

Hey Mike, great to hear that you are thinking of covering the Irish revolution. If you go there, and I hope you do, two pieces of advice if I may... Firstly, don't assume (not that you would) that there is any great historical knowledge to be gained from the Michael Collins film! Secondly, you must listen to a series of 10 lectures given by Michael Laffan on the subject - if you search for The Irish Revolution on itunes, you'll find them easily enough. They are gold! Good luck!

Hi Mike et al, If you told me when I began back in June of 2013 that after 180 episodes I would turn around and do it all over again, I would have said you're nuts. Well, here I am in the middle of round 2. I only remiss that I didn't discover The History of Rome until June. This time around I'm collecting a photo album that has quickly fillied up with detailed maps and pics as I go for reference. At the tender age of 50 I've become a back patio quasi Roman History buff and loving every minute. Thank you Mike falls way short of how I feel, and I'm looking forward to our next adventure in History.

a pleasure to see you back in the saddle and tackling an extensive and rich topic. PErsonally I think you are biting off even more than you did with THoR, as thre is a ton more documentation and live journals from the various revolutions of the more recent past.

I am very much looking forward to hearing your insights into the various revolutions around he world. Welcome back to podcasting, and I look forward to listening and continuing to tell everyone I know thats interested in hostory about your previous and new podcasts!

Hey Mike, I dont know in how far this is usefull but ARD.de (German public radio) has a latin section, which is already broadcasting some programs in latin, that can also be podcasted.
ARD has mighty big radio resources, comparable or even exceeding the BBC's, and they have a latin team in Bremen that probably is aware of your podcast and might be willing to chip in... maybe you should give them a call?? They also do weekly and monthly radio news overviews in latin. Check this:
<a href="http://www.radiobremen.de/nachrichten/latein/uebersetzerteam100.html">http://www.radiobremen.de/nachrichten/latein/uebersetzerteam100.html</a>

PS. According to the ARD.website the only other media-outlets producing similar content are Finnish public radio and Radio Vatican.

Now I'm curios...
In other news, if anyone is interested, I found a podcast that is literally a continuation of THoR. A British guy named Robin Pierson has begun The History of Byzantium and can be found at www.thehistoryofbyzantium.wordpress.com. There are six episodes up so far and Mr. Peirson is doing a wonderful job filling Mr. Duncan's gigantic shoes.  One word of caution though, the show is designed with the assumption that the listener has listened to THoR to completion so, if your not done yet, I would suggest doing so before beginning THoB.

If you're aiming for correct Latin pronunciation in the show, don't bother. The correct Latin for Gaius Julius Caesar would be 'Gah-ee-us Yoo-li-us Kai-sar', and no one pronounces it that way, even professors!

Recently I managed to understand what Asian Handicap is and how to bet it. It is a really great tool and I think every football bettor should consider mastering it. It enables you to earn more and lose less in situations where you know well the form of both teams and you have quite good idea what will happen during the game and if you don’t better find good <a href="http://bultip.com">http://bultip.com</a> football predictions

People who like "The History of Rome" may also like "American Sulla". It's a new novel set in the not-so-distant future that follows loosely the collapse of the Roman Republic.

I've been enjoying it -- an interesting take on one of the most interesting characters in the Republic's fall.

Hi Mike
Been listening to THoR since someone suggested it back in September, and have just finished. It was a fantastic experience, and something I would recommend to anyone with an interest in history. Really like your presentation and perseverance in putting this together. Hope you have time and the energy to do something similar in the future.
All the best

I just stopped by to let you know how much I missed the Sunday evening edition of THOR, and saw this picture.

What a lovely baby!

But really, a baby is no excuse to take my Sunday entertainment away! What kind of priorities do you have? ;-)

God bless. Keep him away from the masks of his ancestors, lest he become consumed with ambition!

Congratulations on the birth of your son. Children are such a joy (and a lot of work). Thank-you for sharing this with us, your fans. As a side note I've been playing catch-up on many missed episodes.  I'm very grateful for all the hard work you did for us listeners. It is a great education for me.

Congrats!  Absolutely stunning.  Best of the Best Mike and Mrs. History of Rome.  It was an absolute privilege to listen while everything was live.  I don't know if you listen to any baseball Mike, but when you hear the same voice for so long they stop being informational and start being old friends.  Youve been on my runs in Austin, on countless plane rides home (I travel every week), on trains, during work, and in the quiet weekday evenings.  I've loved your asides, jokes, and the way youve described it all.  The very very best wishes for you and I do hope you continue on when the time is right- you're so good at it.  If not, best best best wishes.

Given he is the Third Rome,  I'm a little surprised that his name doesn't incorporate Rus within it; then again, that's a historical tidbit for another project.

Good, strong looking son.  May he serve the Pater Familias well!

Extremely rad! Congratulations! That is absolutely fantastic news.

Mike, I just finished listening to "The End" and I got a little emotional. I started listening to the podcast when you were on your seven-month hiatus and it's been a real delight. Your podcast inspired me to do my own history podcast as my senior project and ultimately decide to major in history in college. That was a huge decision not made lightly and THoR pointed me in the right direction. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart. You are truly awesome.

Congrats again Mike.  I’m just dropping a note to let you know that someone has decide to pick up where you left off.

<a href="http://thehistoryofbyzantium.wordpress.com/">http://thehistoryofbyzantium.wordpress.com/</a>

I'm not sure exactly what your plans are for the next podcast and although you said it wouldn't be ancient of American history I suspect it will involve Europe.

If you were to follow European history in the aftermath of the fall of the western empire it would be a great compliment to the Byzantium podcast and would give us all an amazing perspective of the history of the entire region.

You and Mr. Robin could even collaborate as I’m sure he would welcome your advice.  He seems to be a great fan of yours and talented in his own right.

Good luck on your future endeavors.

I'd also like to thank you for helping me on my Latin certification exam. There were about 20 questions about Roman history, and there wasn't a single one I didn't know because I first heard you talking about it on this podcast. You aren't just a good podcaster: you're a life-changer. Thanks again! :D

<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just been alerted to the fact that an interview I did with Podcast Squared a few weeks ago is now posted. We talk about the end of The History of Rome, podcasting theory and the proper legionary formation to deal with angry hippos. Interview starts at minute 25.</p>

I have thoroughly enjoyed the History of Rome & will miss it terribly but I guess I will forgive your ending it for the time being with the baby coming and all. ;) I discovered the podcast via 12 Byzantine Rulers (another excellent offering) a few years ago & want to thank you & your fellow historical type podcasters for providing such wonderful offerings to us history nerds. Best of luck to you & Mrs. HOR with the bebe.

I recently loved:
Shakespeare's Restless World - www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/r4shakespeare
A good look at the details of live in the 1590's.  Eyeopening.

Ancient Warfare Magazine - www.ancient-warfare.com
A look at Roman and Greek topics from a different angle.  The hosts talk a lot about sources, which I love.  You get an idea of how we know what we know.

And though it's long over, a forerunner to THoR was Napoleon 101 - <a href="http://napoleon.thepodcastnetwork.com/">http://napoleon.thepodcastnetwork.com/</a>
If you want another long rambling chronological history story, this was a good 'un.

And good ol' Dan Carlin, Hardcore History -  <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive">http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive</a>
He produced a gripping little run of podcasts on the Fall of the Republic.  The hours fly by on that one.

And...  History According to Bob - <a href="http://www.summahistorica.com/">http://www.summahistorica.com/</a>
He produces a bazillion episodes a week.  Stunning output.  And in his archives is a long journey through Caesar's life.

Oh that's enough.

Well planned, well initiated, and well thought out I will miss the misadventures of all our friendly neighborhood emperors and quasi-emperors.

Hi Mike, So much time has past and I miss my THoR rituals. However I came to check-in today, in part for updates on the young Lordling, as well as listening to some favourite episodes. I'm guessing Sir Elliott is motoring along and trying to grab anything he can get and stuff it in his mouth. Have fun! I hope you are all keeping well and happy.

Thanks for keeping the site up. I still recommend it to anyone with ears who stands still near me:) I also appreciate the other podcast recommendations though I haven't started anything new yet. Taking a sensible breather.

Be well, Val

It's been a long, strange trip, Mike, and even though I wish you were continuing, I understand why you can't.  Thank you so much for the time you've put into this and the enjoyment you've given me.  It just won't be the same without your weekly commentary.  Best of luck with the baby.  I know it's going to be an even wilder ride with more twists and turns, successes and reverses than the history of Rome (and when the kid becomes a toddler, you'll know what the Romans felt like when they saw the Vandals approach the city).  Anyway, best wishes, and as the Romans would have said, Vale et pax tecum.

And now it's ended!! :(

I hear you won't continue with the Byzantine Empire :( but I understand. Priorities.

I've shared THoR with some bright young people and gotten them hooked on Roman history--you've made a bigger impact than you might realize. Enjoy your baby!

I really can't thank you enough Mike for this wonderful podcast that has given me so many, many hours of entertainment.

This was one of the first podcasts that I started listening to several years ago, and is still by far the best on my now substantial list of podcasts.

I'm really not sure what I'm going to do now without my weekly fix of Roman history, except I guess go back and listen to them all again.

Thanks again, and best wishes for the future.

I've been listening slowly to these for a long time. I'm behind on the podcast, I think the East/West split still hasn't happened.  I wanted to drop you a note thanking you for the work.  I've really enjoyed these podcasts and a bit disappointed the show is over, and great job.

Looking forward to whatever is next.  I listened to this podcast out of order to catch up on the news :)

I've been busy teaching for the past couple of months, and was catching up on The History of Rome this weekend, so it came as a shock that I was getting back into it just in time for the final episode. I don't think I'll be able to find a history podcast with as much depth, and certainly not one that's as deadpan hilarious, as THoR to replace it.

It turns out this month marks a turning point in my life as well, since I'm moving from Michigan, where I've lived for the last eleven years, back to my home state of Colorado. It seems appropriate that THoR, which has been a semi-constant fixture in my life for nearly half of my time here in MI, is ending at the same time.

Good luck to you and Mrs. History of Rome on your own new chapter! (And should you ever think about starting another podcast on another historical era, and should I be once again gainfully employed, I'd pay more than just the pittance I'm donating now for the privilege of hearing it.)

Salve, Mike.  This podcast has been a regular part of my life for years - since probably episode 8 or 9.  I can't thank you enough for all of your hard work, and all the learning, fascination, and amusement it has brought.  I'm heartbroken this particular series is coming to an end, but I know we'll hear many great things from you in the future.  All the best wishes for your new family!

All I can do is add to the thank yous. I honestly can't remember when I started listening, but it was after the 'hiatus' - as you mentioning it in this episode is the first I've heard of it.

It's become a daily routine for me to download the episode each week on a Monday morning (I live in the UK), and listen to it on the way to work. I've changed jobs twice since I started listening, so each episode will have it's own memory linked with it. It's a very strange and special thing to look back on.

In my opinion, you should keep this feed as a standalone body of work, and start a new one for the next podcast. The History of Rome should stay just that; after all, I still have people to tell about it!

A donation will be on the way soon. Good luck in the future, podcast or no podcast. Thanks again, Rob.

Dear Mike,

I have been silently following your podcast for about 8 or 9 months now. It was the first (and thus far only) podcast I downloaded and since I didn't get in on the ground floor, I had the pleasure of catching up on dozens of episodes without having to wait for new releases. I only really sort of caught up a few weeks ago. I'm sad that it is the end. I'm up to Attila Cometh right now, but after typing this, I'm going to skip to The End, for the bittersweet sign off.

You have produced a work of immense erudition and entertainment. My father, after hearing a few episodes with me while driving, described you as a latter-day Gibbon. I agree. I really hope that you do publish a book, one that preserves the little jokes and asides that made this podcast great. Also, I too would buy the CD.

You have gone above and beyond in every way with this series. I am sure there are many, many thousands more like me who have hitherto been silent in the comments but have enjoyed your work. I've recommended it to random people on the train who I have spotted with books on Roman history.

Like everyone else, I hope that one day you will be able to return and see the Eastern Empire through to 1453 (if only for Justinian, Theodora and Bellisarius). I also look forward to any other project of yours.

All the very best to you and Mrs The History of Rome in raising the heir to the Duncan Dynasty.

Ave! I think we all here would hail you as Augustus.


Kind regards,

Joseph

First time listener, first time commenter.

First, thank you Mike for the wonderful podcast.

I found THoR about 2.5 years ago at a time I was just starting to get interested in learning more about Rome.  I downloaded and listened to the first episode and was hooked.

You did a great job of of being very informative and teaching a subject to people who may have not known anything about it, while at the same time keeping things very light and funny.  There were days at work when I was doing mindless monkey-work where I would listen to THoR for 7-8 hours straight for multiple days in a row, there aren't many people whose voice I could stand to have in my head for that period of time.

Thank you again and good luck with the family and everything else in your future.

谢谢 and danke schön and thanks. Also thanks for using my line "the history of the history of Rome" even if you didn't actually get it from me in the comments last year but rather made it up yourself. Now I would like to offer some wild speculation on your next project:

* The history of China
* ... of India
* ... of Germany
* ... of science and technology
* ... of England
* The dark ages: not so dark after all
* The middle ages: wow, a lot of stuff happened
* kittens: are they not cute?

Ok, the last one is somewhat unlikely.

I started listening since around the time of the Punic Wars and listening to THoR has been a staple in my life ever since. I've followed you since you went through the hiatus, death of your grandfather, marriage and move to Austin, the Tour (which I went on), removal of your appendix, and finally the birth of your child. The podcast, which covered 448,663 days of ancient history, I will always cherish. I will buy the collectors edition CD set if you make it available. Best of luck in your future endeavors.

We've made it through long days of university by listening to this podcast and will simply go back to the beginning and do it all over again. 189 episodes have gotten us through our daughters' being born, our wedding and honeymoon, graduating from Paris University and starting at Leeds University and we've enjoyed every second.

All the best once again and we hope to hear you with the new project in the future.

Mike,

Just dropped in a donation.  Have you thought of editing the tHoR onto CD's and selling them?  or maybe setting up a convenience address for your fans to ship Roman themed baby clothes, like T-shirts reading, "What is this?  I was supposed to be born to a Roman emperor. . .not a Roman historian. . ."

I want to echo the thanks.  I've really enjoyed the podcast over the years.  When you relocated to Austin, I immediately began thinking of THoR as a "hometown podcast."  After you announced you were leaving, I finally bit the bullet and subscribed to Audible through your page's offer.  For those who haven't, it's a good way to show appreciation, and a great replacement fix now that the podcast is over.

Thanks for all the work and wonderful history lessons.  I have been listening almost from the beginning and was quite envious of your move to Austin (ex-Austinite, wishing for an excuse to move back to raise my toddler in one of the best cities in the world).

Your podcast helped inspire me to take up an online history masters course.  I chose the American Revolution, so quite selfishly suggest that as your next podcast theme, should you ever do another one.

I now have one less to look forward to Monday mornings!  Actually your podcast might  have the only thing I enjoyed about Mondays.

Best of luck for you and your family in whatever you end up doing.

Mike,

I have been listening to your podcast every week for...at least 3 years.  I loved it, and appreciate all of your hard work.  I have downloaded and kept of all of the old episodes and listen to the old ones all of the time.  Like you, I prefer early Roman history.  Incidentally, I am a UT alum, and lived in Austin for 20 years, moving to D.C. only a few months after you moved there.

All the best.

Thank you for this last episode. Having things summed up this way is great, though we would have all understood if you had had to skip it.

One of the great things is that this is ending on a huge note; the birth of your son. Rome ended for a host of reasons, but in the end it came down to the people no longer wanting the Empire. It was too fraught with danger in the West. The History of Rome Podcast ends on a note of hope and promise. All happiness to your family.

Best wishes to you and your family. I look forward to hearing about your next podcast soon.

Reasons why Rome fell.....

It's been interesting hearing about Rome's attitudes towards border security.  It has such strong parallels to current day issues.  You could use the Roman example to either show that you should shut the borders tight and don't let the barbarians in, only to pillage our lands and take our jobs and ruin our cultural purity. (insert smiley, if that's needed)  Or that a nation needs to be flexible and accommodating and figure out how to work with these Others.

One could make the case either way.

Anyway, see you around whenever you are around.
Enjoy the sleepless nights and projectile liquid poop.
Trust me, whatever the environmental impact may be, disposable nappies make baby maintenance far less gooey.

Mike - Thank you so, so much for all of your thoughtful research, your dedication to the podcast, your witty and clever commentary, and your sheer force of will that has driven the History of Rome podcast.

I began listening January 2010, and within a span of four months became caught up with all the past episodes, and eagerly awaited every Sunday evening / Monday commute home to listen to your newest release. It was practically a highlight of my week.

In the year 2011, my wife and I traveled around the world (literally) for our honeymoon. We spent a pretty good deal of time in Italy, and also Turkey. We happened to be there right around the time you were giving your tours, but our travel budget didn't allow us to actually join in on the fun. We did, however, pay attention to the itinerary, and went to many of the places you suggested on your tour. Sorry if you feel like we might have crashed your party, but we definitely enjoyed our time and talked about you a lot.

I'm just about to start a great new job tomorrow, and after I get my first paycheck, I plan on donating to THOR mightily. You've provided so much entertainment, education, food for thought, topics for discussion, points to ponder, opinions to discuss, and pure delight for the past two and a half years, and I'm sad to see the History of Rome podcast come to and end. I wait with great anticipation for your next big project.

And congratulations on becoming a father! Hooray for you!
-Joseph

I have downloaded the last HoR podcast to listen to on my Monday walk, as I have been doing for so many episodes.  Thank you for so many hours of entrtainment and education.  Best of luck on becoming a new parent.  Rome was not built in a day, and neither is becoming a Dad.  Constantine changed the nature of the Empire, and becoming a Dad will forever change your life.  May the gods/God hold you and your family close.  Should you decide to continue the Roman saga, I will again be your faithful listener.

Just thanks so much, Mike. I listened from about episode 3 or 4, and will miss Sunday nights greatly. But now I've got my chance to go back and re-listen, opening multiple Wikipedia pages and multiple maps, to try to really absorb what happened.

I hope you realize how much good will you've got out in the world. If I were emperor I would have you wear a toga that said "I made The History of Rome Podcast" and you would never have to pay for your own beer ever again.

Best. Podcast. Ever! I stumbled across THoR when you were up to Julius Caesar and the end of the republic. I was hooked immediately, and your podcast has been without a doubt my favourite.  I will be listening to them all again from the beginning.  Thankyou so much for vastly increasing my knowledge of the Ancient world, and giving me the thirst to learn even more about the Roman Empire.  Your podcast will be sorely missed each week.  Congratulations to you and your wife, you will no doubt be a Dad who tells the best stories.

Hey Mike,

I have been listening since Octavian, and i'd like to thank you for what you've done. Your podcasts (oddly) helped me through a pretty bad period of my life right after my parents divorced and we had to sell the house. Getting lost in the story of rome was a great reprieve from the stress of modern life.

I wish you all the best, and even though the old Roman honor and spirit kinda died off after Diocletian, i still am going to miss the weekly history podcast.

All the best,

-Ryan Leonard

Was so happy when I found this podcast after listening to the 12 Byzantine Emperors back in 2007-08, and have loved every minute of the journey with you.  Have listened to the show all the way through twice over now, and will be starting over again soon!

Thank you so much for all of your hard work, congrats with the family, and good luck in all your future endevors!

Thanks so much, Mike!  You did an excellent job in producing The History of Rome podcast.  I am very excited about your upcoming history podcast and am looking forward to future listening.  If it's not ancient history or American history, then perhaps it will be about medieval European history.  I wish you much success regardless of what you do.  Congrats to you and Mrs. The History of Rome on the baby boy!  BTW, what area are you studying at the University of Texas?

Thanks Mike. Your podcast has been a part of my life during grad school. It has helped keep me sane. And to go along with your "omens" decision to end the show now, I find it very fitting that you posted the final episode the same night I finished my dissertation. It's nice to bring to major parts of my life to close on the same evening.

Good luck, and we better hear from you again in the future, after some well deserved time off.

thank you very much for your time & dedication.
as you mentioned in the final episode, i'd also listened to the byzantine empire podcast & then searched for a history of rome one. options were limited and yours was the only one with high quality.

hopefully you consider upgrading the sound & then selling dvds, as well as mp3's. 9.99 or even 29.99 to purchase/download the entire series via itunes with sharper sound would be well worth it for me.

thank you for sealing the deal with this episode.

all the best.

Best podcast on the net.

Best wishes to your new boy, Gaius perhaps?

I wish you and Mrs. THoR the best with your new addition.  Life shall be even more wonderful with this new investment of time.

Thanks for the wonderful podcasts!  I mostly listen to them while falling asleep at night:  with two young kids of my own I have few other opportunities to listen these days.  This means that I can listen to them all over again and catch things I missed the first time -- lucky me.

To repeat what an earlier commenter said, there are few voices that I could listen to for such a long time without the experience becoming either grating or monotonous, but yours is one of them.

Best of luck with your baby. Your whole life is about to be turned upside down - mostly in a good way.  Donation sent, and I look forward to your next project :)

I've never posted here before, though I have been a fan since finding this podcast in late 2009. Like many others here, I can't say enough about how great this podcast has been. If 12 Byzantine Rulers - a podcast I found based on your work here - was your inspiration, let me say that you surpassed it with ease. I have enjoyed every episode in the little over 2 years I've been listening, and your efforts are a shining example for how powerful the internet is.

I'm grateful for all your work, and hope my very young daughters will sit through every episode when they're old enough to be covering the Roman Empire in school. I look forward to your next project, and have fun becoming a dad!

Cheers, and until next time...

It's a wonderful podcast, I have enjoyed learning so much, and I hope you (and I) have a ball with your next project. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Thank you very much for all your work and your enthusiasm, and your perseverance. I have enjoyed listening, learning and daydreaming about Rome for four years thanks to your podcast.

I am not a native English speaker, but the way you talk has made it much easier for me to keep listening. You are a talented speaker. I didn't just learn roman History, I improved my English too.

Finally, as a student of history, I want to thank for the quality of your research, your criticism of the sources, and the distinction you always make between your guesses, the documented facts, and the untrustworthy sources.

Your podcast is one of my favourite. There had to be and end, though. I will definitely start listening again from the beginning so I won't miss so much the new episodes.

Thank you very much, congratulations about your Baby, and a big hug from Hispania.

Thanks Mike for this amazing podcasts that has expanded my interest of history back 1000 years from medieval europe to the founding of Rome. It's been real fun seeing how all those little admin changes in late roman history laid the seeds for feudal society. My life is richer for having listened to this. Thanks again, to you and Mrs History of Rome, good luck for future and see you round.

I am not sure how it all started... Can't remember when and can't remember how.. But a couple of years ago I started listening to your podcast and my interest into the history of Rome has grown.. a lot.

Thank Jupiter that you have made some 200 podcasts (I dare say some 100hrs of listening time) and thank Juno that Gibbon has also been a prolific writer.. there is also Stephen Dando-Collins, Robert Graves, John Maddox Roberts and others which came thanks to your podcasts so my addiction to Rome and all things Roman can be satisfied.

But, I am very sad to see you go. Very very sad.

Mr Duncan thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. Its been a pleasure... and it will be for a long time by the Neptune with the repeat listening... I hope that one day when the baby grows up you might return with something new. I also hope for the book...

Again, thank you very much.

Thanks for your witty & fascinating tales of the wonderful personalities through the life of the Roman empire.  Please, please do something else & advertise it here.

Mike,
What can I say? Thank you for a great journey. I stopped studying history back in 1984 at age 14. Your podcast has awoken an interest in history that I never knew I had.  Thanks to you, I've been ploughing through Tacitus, both Plinys, Livy and the rest.  I had a go at reading the works of Marcus Aurelius. I've read up on the fall of Rome and now know far more about ice cores, pottery fragments and isotope analysis than I ever thought necessary. Me and my eldest son are doing our best to learn rudimentary latin together. I'm still not sure I like the Romans, but your podcast has been fantastic.

I look forward to your return to podcasting whenever that may be. Good luck to you and your wife with the next stage in your life together. Being a parent is a blast. Please post an update just to let us know what you call your son , if nothing else!
Cheers

Thanks Mike for this.  Its bitter sweet getting to the end now. Like closing the cover on a great book - one you've been reading for years straight. Like many fans I've listened to many episodes many times (particular favourite are the Julius Caesar episodes).  Walking to work, out for a run, grocery shopping you've been there and will be missed.

Ever thought of going back and tweaking certain episodes to add / amend things with the benefit of hindsight (not that they weren't all perfect)?

Looking forward to the next project.

All the best to you and your family. Thanks again.

Thanks, Mike. It has been great listening these last few years, I think I started around Episode 11, and I look forward to your next project. Whatever and whenever that may be.

Wow I wish my history class in school was this much fun.  I am going to miss your dry humor.  Best wishes to your family.  I wish I could live in Austin, sounds like a great place.  Say hi to Adam Curry and Alex Jones for me (my other podcast favorites).  I just sent you a little donation.  Thanks, I can't wait for your next project.

Thank you Mike for this great podcast. I found the History of Rome series by chance about a year ago, and instantly became fascinated by your podcasts.

Since then, the comings and goings of the Roman empire have taught me a great many things about history and your episodes have accompanied me to jogging, gym, washing dishes, walking to work, etc. This has been the best podcast series I've ever encountered (and I've listened to a few!) Good luck in the future!

I have to say Mike I have listened to many comprehensive histories of Rome and I would argue this is the best I've ever heard.  I came across your podcast completely by accident and it has been incredible over these past few years. I'm sad to see it go but I agree with you that this is the right time and you made a good decision.  I'm looking forward to your future endeavors.

This is the first comment I've posted here, but with the podcast coming to an end, I felt like I had to leave a note and say how much I've enjoyed it over the past few years. I got started relatively late (around episode 80), but got caught up to speed in a couple furious weeks of listening, and have caught every episode since as soon as it came out. Most of the early episodes (from the more cheerful parts of Roman history) I've listened to several times, and even though the history is done, I'm still going to be relistening to old podcasts for as long as I can foresee. The effort you've put into making this podcast has been incredible, the quality has been constantly top-notch, and the weekly ritual of a new episode has come to mean more to me than I realized until it's suddenly over. Best of luck with the baby, and I'll certainly be an avid listener of whatever the new podcast is going to be, whenever you have time to bring it to fruition. Thanks for everything!

Dear Mike:

I almost started this by saying that it's a sad day, but then realised it would be daft and kind of insulting to call the imminent birth of your son "sad."  So instead I will say that this is a momentous day.  Honestly, I feel like the final History of Rome podcast is a life cycle event because your podcasts have been such a valued part of my life for the past five years.

I found your podcast in 2007 around episode 4 or 5 while I was spending a lot of time on site at Fermilab outside of Chicago, during which time my wife and I were living apart: I in London and she in Boston.  Since then I have been a devoted listener and massive fan.  I've listened to episodes at Fermilab, at CERN in Switzerland, at KEK and J-PARC in Japan, and at meetings and conferences in New Zealand, India, Spain, Poland, and Greece.  I've listened to them at home in London, at my wife's former apartment in Boston, at my Mom's house in Chicago, and on airplanes in between all those places.  I like to listen to a few episodes while doing household chores and yard work, so that trimming my hedge now always reminds me of Teutoborg Nightmares.  And yes, I have even listened to History of Rome episodes in Rome.

The main reason I'm sorry that the podcast is ending is because it has been so great.  I will really miss the weekly history fun-time, and I was hoping you'd continue to fill the massive gaps in my historical knowledge.  I was also hoping that one of these years I'd be able to actually join the History of Rome Tour, but my schedule never allowed for it (I blame Livia).  Finally, I'm sad because I feel like a friend is moving away.  It's probably a little creepy to be called a friend by a person you've never met, but with 75 hours of your voice on my iPod, I feel like I know you.  (Another reason I'm bummed about having missed the Tours.)

You will probably never know how many people you've touched with the podcast. I don't think I can communicate that to you and I absolutely cannot pay you back for the amount of enjoyment you've given me.  But if you ever happen to be in Japan, or Switzerland, or Chicago, and you would like to tour a particle physics lab, let me know.

I wish all the best for you and Mrs The History of Rome, and of course for The Son of The History of Rome.  Although it's a low probability event, I still hold out a little hope for the Return of the History of Rome---maybe Return by the Son of the History of Rome?

Yours,
Morgan

Thank you for these GREAT podcasts!  You made the history of Rome come to life for me!

I also want to thank you for being the nexus for my own journey into the study of ancient history.  You introduced me to Rome and then to Audible.  Since then I've read and or listened to numerous books by such great writers as Herodotus, Livy, Homer, Caesar, Juvenal, Plato, Aristotle, etc..

Your vivid recounts of this time period has made me a lover of the classical world and broadened my mind in ways I can't begin to adequately explain.

I look forward to your next project and wish you and the Mrs. good luck on the birth of your child.

PS.  I loved the joke about Livia possibly having killed off Leo II!

I would like to thank you for the wonderful podcast you made Mike. I can only imagine the time and effort you have put on it and the result was fantastic. I’m sad it is over and I will miss to expect and listen for a new episode every week but eventually it had to end and I can’t think on a better reason than a baby, the beginning of the great adventure as you will soon discover.
You have advance with the idea of trying to make the book of History of Rome and if you ever deiced to make it I believe you have everything to make it as good as the podcast and be sure that I will buy it.
I will save the podcast episodes since I’m sure I will listen them many more times and when my children can understand English I will also recommend them. I will stay tune and waiting for discover your next project. But if you don’t mind I say it first enjoy the fatherhood. It can’t ever be so well enjoyed as when the first child arrives.
My best wishes to you and to your family.

It's been part of my daily life for about 18 months - coming with me from Australia to China - as I caught up with the program; and then awaited the next instalment - I've already started again from the beginning because I can't get enough.

Best of luck in the future for you and your family.

i've dreaded this day for a long time - your magisterial podcast has brightened up my monday mornings since i first episode i downloaded -  way back at ep14a or b "A phlanx with Joints' - History of Rome is that rarest of things - authoritive its is depth & scope, but never academic or dull, and imbued with great humor & wit. e.g 'dear old Marcus Agrippa - we should all hope to have best friends as utterly kickass as  Marcus Agrippa' - bravo! & so true -  one of my favourite lines of the whole epic series!

I wish you the best in everthing that you do & hope you return someday with another equally awesome podcast - i seem to recall during the 'hunderdeth episode' you mentioned a history of the civil war or the conquest of the american west or persia?

this is a landmark podcast series IMHO, and deserves to be put in the Library of Congress as an examplar of just how powerful a medium of education podcacsts can be.

You efforts are worthy of the 'corona obsidionalis' no less

Hi,
Here's another post to thank-you for the podcast.
I joined you on about episode 40 - and caught up over about a month. I've listened to the podcast on my walk to work ever since.

Good luck with the fatherhood (I hope your new ruler won't be too much of a tyrant)

And good luck with whatever you do next (those Greeks had some history, didn't they, nudge-nudge)

I have loved this podcast since discovering it 2 years ago, and I will sorely miss it.

Just a suggestion....
I think you should seriously consider doing a history of Egypt.
It is a LOOONG subject, so there's a lot of job security. And the subject matter is diverse and endlessly debated, leaving plenty of space for comedy asides. Also there is a real dearth of relateable material on the subject.

Wish I could say I was a longtime listener, but I only discovered The History of Rome a couple of months ago. In that time, I've made if from Romulus to Valentinian III.  I will miss it terribly. Ancient Rome has always been by second-favorite historical topic (after the US Civil War), and I've learned more about it in the past couple of months than in the rest of the 40-odd years of my lifetime. Many thanks; congratulations on becoming a father.

Well Mike,

just about to listen to The End now but with a heavy heart.

You have been my travel companion for some years now and it's hard to believe that soulful voice will be leaving me.

You have set the standard for the pod-cast medium.There are some great ones out there but, oh boy, yours is the best.

Early on in you described how as a boy you were captivated by Gibbon's descriptions of Ancient Rome. Gibbon may possibly have been England's greatest historian. What you have achieved is right up there.

I wish you and Mrs THOR all the best and much happiness with your new family.

I hope to hear you on the airwaves one day soon...

I can remember when I discovered this podcast.  My girlfriend (now wife) had gotten me into listening to podcasts with eps of This American Life, but I was looking for something based on history, my longtime passion.  I found this little podcast on a subject I didn't know much about (my own interests tended towards Early Modern Europe and the American Civil War).  I mean...I knew almost nothing about Rome other than the standard stuff.  And I was lucky...I only had 20 or so eps to catch up on before continuing if I liked it.

So I started listening...my first ep involved the Romans using the same tactics vs. elephants that "the Rebel Alliance" used.  Needless to say...I was hooked.  I can even remember debating whether or not to just delete the feed during Mike's hiatus...since it had just been forever since it had posted anything.  And then the excitement when out of nowhere, I looked and itunes was downloading a new episode.

Most weeks, this was my morning commute - listening on Metro in DC...and later, post my move to Atlanta, on my Monday drive.  But I also listened to episodes in Costa Rica on my honeymoon...on a long business trip to China last year...and several endless drives back and forth to Florida.

I believe I'm not alone in this "Senate" to say that you've earned your Triumph - and you've earned the right to proclaim to the world: "Veni, vidi, vici."  I wish you well and can't wait for whatever you do next.  Happy wishes to you and your family.

Mike

So sad to see the end of this. It's become part of my life. Every Monday I listen to the podcast on the way to work since episode 15. I was scared by the break just before the republic ended and thought that was it. Now I must face life with definitly no more. Not even the promise of another slice of ancient history.

To you as an individual I must say "brilliant what an achievement" you should be incredibly proud. To the community as a whole it almost feels like a bereavement.

Enjoy and cherish your new arrival. It's all you can do to pass on to another generation and this I guess will put history into a new prospective.

It would be a pity to leave it there. There must be another topic you could address. Nobody as yet has done a proper greek or persian history podcast (apologies if they have and I've missed it). Just a thought. Mull it over during the 3:00 am feeds.

Enjoy the rest (although you won't get it) you deserve it after this opus maximus.

Richard

Hmm, no ancient or american.  There's already england, russian, chinese, and japanese history podcasts...perhaps France?  Perhaps one focused on 16th through 18th century?  16th through 18th is amazingly cool and not covered very much.  Any way, I'll be excited to see what it is.

But you should also take stock of what a tremendous accomplishment you've done. Even if no one ever listened to this podcast, putting out 74 hrs of quality material is a tremendous accomplishment. Kudos for doing something you actually loved and having the commitment to stick it out to the end.  You are an inspiration to more than just podcasters. Get ya a case of beer for that!

I'll add one more comment (and I absolutely mean this with no disrespect whatsoever) but your podcast is perfect for either keeping me awake  or putting me to sleep. The facts are so interesting, your voice so soothing. So sometimes I listen to the old episodes again and it puts me in a restful place. You got me through many a red eye flight.

Best of luck to you and your growing family.

P.S. I was going to guess that you are going to do a podcast of the British Empire but since there is a British history podcast out, I wonder if you'll cover the same ground, only better.

Ok, let's start guessing what Mike is coming up with next.  I have a few suggestions / guesses:

History of baseball.  Ok, so it's not going to last quite as long but instead of emperors you could use managers.  Heck, Billy Martin was as crazy as any of those wackos.  Earl Weaver could have been a stand in for the guy who blew a blood vessel.  You could have a three parter on Randy Johnson if you want.

History of Hoover vacuum cleaners...naaa

Am I close yet?

Send in your own suggestions folks!

Optimus.  Yes, sir, the best and most complete history of Rome you can find anywhere.  Seriously.  Unless someone unearths another 25 volumes of Livy, it will probably stay that way.  Over 70 hours of good, clean fun- including stuff that nobody else discusses.  Where can you find hours of stuff on obscure figures such as Aetius? Or Philip the Arab?

Mike, as a long time listener (I stumbled on your podcast sometime in fall 2007), I want to say that you'll be greatly missed in my listening lineup. As an ancient world history teacher, I gained a new appreciation for this period in history, and I still remember the kick my students got out of the story of the sacred chickens you shared from the First Punic War. It sounds like you have an exciting new chapter in life to explore now, but if time permits, I would greatly enjoy a study of the Byzantine and Russian portions of history (since some might argue that the Roman Empire finally fell in 1917 ;)). Best of luck to you, and fantastic work on this epic series.

Thanks for all the hard work Mike. I jumped in on this amazing podcast right around the time of "The Spear of Destiny." I quickly caught up, in about a week or two. But the it was agonizing waiting for every Monday morning to download a new episode, and when you were gone sometimes I about died:). I'm sad to hear that THoR won't continue anymore:( but I appreciate all that you've done, i've been listening to this podcast for so long, it's truly amazing.

Got into THoR at the behest of my father, right around episode 50 or so. I can't even begin to tell you much I have enjoyed your work, and how sad I am that it's now at an end. Much as I'd have loved it to just go on and on and on, I do understand - and both congratulations and good luck with your new baby.

Thank you for the History of Rome. It's been incredible.

Mike, Thank you so much for this podcast.  While mildly interested in history, I'd never dug into Rome prior to discovering your podcast.

I discovered it some time in late 2010, while commuting to a job that I loathed, but had stayed with to provide for my family.  Rapidly blazing through episode after episode, I had the company of your podcast to help keep me sane--something to look forward to for the trip in, something to let me relieve my stress on the way home.

The early time was amazing, moving from episode to episode, knowing one day I'd catch up with the recording schedule.  When that happened, I found myself eagerly awaiting each new episode--listening on Monday morning's commute...over so quickly, but again eager for the next.

I'm sure that I've bored countless colleagues with various tidbits that filled in gaps, or provided info I'd never thought to look up (Who built the Coliseum?  When exactly did the Romans reach Britain?).

As cheesy as this might sound, I can honestly state that this podcast had a profound impact on me, and I cannot thank you enough for the work you've put into it--the depth of your research, the excellent storytelling and your enthusiasm and love for it.  Thanks to you and Mrs. History of Rome for the time you've put into creating it.

As the father of two small children, I know the excitement of what's coming, and I know you'll have a wonderful time!  Best of luck with your new addition!

Eagerly keeping the feed open for what comes next!

  Thank you dearly, Mike. My sister got me interested around episode 50, and I've been a loyal listener ever since. I've recommended this show to as many people as were interested in learning, and a few at least stuck. I liked to let a few episodes build up, then go and listen to the last 5-10 episodes I'd already heard and keep going with the new ones and go on a THoR binge.

  I listen to a ton of podcasts, but I've never had one end before, so this is a sad parting for me. But I am truly glad to have known you indirectly, to have been able to listen to this show, and to hope for the best for you and your family.

  Thank you!

Man...I've subscribed to dozens of podcasts and I always reach the same point with them. The point where I'm looking at my iPod and think "Man, I'm sick of listening to these people talk. What else do I have?" The one show that was an exception was The History of Rome. Ups and downs, rain or shine, this was the reason I gave a damn about Mondays and I'll miss it. It'll be sad to have nothing to download just before I head out into the City.

Mike, you did a fantastic job. Your care, passion and detail is what made this podcast great. I'll be watching this feed for the next fifty years if that's how long it takes you to get back to it. :)

Good luck with the kid. Much love.

Your podcast has been, for the whole length of my time in grad school, the first that I will listen to when I update the stack of podcasts on my iPod, and the most eagerly anticipated! I will miss it, and the journey into Roman History that it provides.

Looking forward to your next podcast, though it's only right and proper that your son gets the benefit of your story-telling ability now.

Thankyou, and farewell (for now)

(and I would most heartily recommend, with others, the idea of releasing the whole podcast, either in book form or as an mp3 CD (audio CD wouldn't work very well with 74 hours...))

Dear Mike
Your podcast has been a constant companion to my commute these many years. You've filled in so many of the blanks for me in understanding how the Empire rose, developed and fell I am in your debt.

A truly great accomplishment, particularly as a self funded one. Hats off also to your good lady wife, it's a rare woman indeed that will support a man in such endeavours.

Finally the very best of luck to you all in your adventures together with the little one. You're going to love it

For those that want to pick up where this left off I thoroughly recommend dancarlin.com episode 'Thors Angels'4 hours of the rise of the Germans post the fall of Rome. Enjoy!

Thanks for the best podcast available.

It's a good thing you did it, as if it had been left to me it would have been rubbish (and much shorter).

I'm (un)fashionably late to the party as ever and am currently listening my way through those wacky Severins, but I thought I should add my voice to the chorus of praise and best wishes that accompanies the final collapse of the Western Empire. No, that doesn't sound right, does it?

I lived the Punic wars, the truimvarites, and the carnage as Rome began to disintegrate. Thanks for making such a comprehensive podcast that was so informative and humourous at the same time.

I hope your next podcast is on medieval Europe and picks up where you left off! Please make the cd. Theres people I could buy that for who would never listen to a podcast but would listen to a cd. It's a great idea.

Your stories are well-organized, and you managed to bring some potentially dry periods of Roman history to life. Congratulations and thanks for sticking with it so long.

If you're really brave, you can even get a Roman History degree in college... :) Never before, though, has tHoR been so fun and entertaining in all its previous incarnations during my school years! Thanks again for such a great, amazing ride and the best of luck for your future endeavors!

Even though it was obvious you were going to end, as the Roman Empire did finally crumble, it's still a shock and I'm gonna take a few more weeks/months to get over it.
But I want to say thank you for reminding why I used to love the Ancient World so much as a child, and getting me to rediscover it again.
Thanks again and you will be sorely missed. But good luck with the future.  When's the book coming out ?

This is like saying goodbye to an old friend. I loved your sense of irony. Absolutely right for Roman history. I've been an ancient Rome freak at least since the "I Claudius" series which we can't watch now because I couldn't keep my mouth shut with all my pearls of wisdom.
Quite simply in my opinion if you don't understand ancient Rome  you don't understand anything about our society.
I'll miss this terribly but Mazeltov on the birth of your son and all the best for the future.

I'm hungry for more. The History of Rome Podcast wouldn't have been the same if not for your fantastic narrative sharing abilities. Which is really what I will miss the most. I can always read and re-read Gibbons but what I will miss the most is your charming personality and the wit you brought to the podcast. Cheers buddy.

Thank you for all of the hard work, it is very much appreciated. I have loved Roman history since early on and was lucky enough to visit Rome in the late 90's. Your podcasts pull together the vastness of the history in a way that brings it all to life and makes people want to learn even more. I wish I could go back to Rome and I'm sure the trip would be even better and more meaningful with all the new knowledge.

Best of luck on the new family and whatever else you have planned.

(I agree that people would pay for cd's or something similar as has been suggested. Also, please do some additional lectures related to Rome in addition to your new project. Similar perhaps to your Christmas special. You have a captive audience, that all loves Roman history. Give the mob what they want.)

I do a weekly music podcast, and I know it can't be the highest item on your priority list each week.  Best of luck with your growing family!  I look forward to what you come up with next!

This was just fantastic.  I started listening in January of this year and absolutely tore through it.  Good luck with the baby!  For what it is worth, I have 3 boys, age 2 to 5, and they love it too.  Our in-car conversation works this way:

Me: "OK guys, do you want to listen to music or history of Rome."

Gaggle of toddlers: "History of Rome!"

No kidding - this actually happens.

Best of luck, and thanks for the fantastic story.

Mike,
I started listening to The History of Rome mid 2010, just at the beginning of my senior year in High School in Houston, TX.  I had a lot to catch up with as you can imagine! I used to listen driving to and from school...those were the days!  I think I got up-to-date about three months ago with your second round of tours...well I'm now at the end of my first year at the Unversity of Edinburgh in Scotland and its difficult to know what I'm going to listen to now.  Have to find something else I suppose!  Thanks a million, and good luck with your family.  Perhaps when they're grown up you can do the History of Byzantium on whatever audio medium we'll be using then.  I'll be listening :)

Valet, Thomas Ware

I too would buy a CD should you decide to produce one. I know I can simply burn one myself from the files saved on my computer, but it would be a nice to have the official "signed by the author" collection.
Please thank your wife for her dedication to the podcast (as the occasional podcast widow), and best of luck in your future.  Hope to hear from you again soon,

But you've kept it as alive and fresh and exciting as Bill Bryson would. I always anticipated a new episode and now I'll have to go back and listen all over again as I anticipate your next adventure.

Thank you so much for doing this. As the last episode ended, I remembered what I was thinking when I listened to the first episode a year ago:  This is exactly what I want to learn.
I learned a lot more than I expected. I can't agree more with you about the Crisis of the Third Century. Before I had only inklings of what that was about from scanning Wikipedia, and now your podcast has fascinated me with not just that period, but the late empire and entire transition to the so-called Dark Ages.
Thanks.

THANK YOU x179 (more including the parts of the Punic Wars)

Been a great journey, I managed to catch up around episode 100, so I had not realised there was a hiatus after Marius. Ending it here is both logical and rather neat with a Romulus at both ends.

I am sure all your listeners will agree that we learned a lot, were entertained throughout and look forward to your next series of podcasts. Intrigued! Slowly going through your recommendation of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, not quite as enjoyable as your readings.

Best wishes to all The History of Rome family, thank you.

Dear Mike - life is going to be a lot less exciting without your company. I started listening only a few episodes into your marvelous endevour, and have continually been struck by your outstanding way of bringing on the story. Wit and knowledge, language and rhythm have been imbued with what always seemed to be a loving distance to the subject - like someone superior to all the petty stupid things and the more loving the essence of the subject.
I have taken the show over again a few times, and will no doubt return to some of the episodes every once in a while - if only for nostalgic reasons. The good old days of Marius and Cincinnatus and - I believe it was Livia, as well...
The History of Rome helped me get through a tough time in my life and career. Thank you! And good luck with your own attribution to the history of mankind - its an adventure in itself, not always easy, but more giving than demanding.

Mike, thank you so much!  I have been listening since I found you on iTunes somewhere between 2 and 3 years ago, and you have done beyond a marvelous job!  You have conveyed the huge history of this historic people, nation, and empire.  You have captured the nature of the society, from its technical brilliance to its noble civilizing grace, and from its petty cruelties to its genocidal intent and actions.  And you have done all of this with wit and great story telling prowess.

I have had an interest in Roman history since my teens.  There are many popular histories of some key moments - the Spartacus revolt, Julius Caesar, the Julio-Claudians, Constantine, etc - but to have a comprehensive history from the founding of the city to the fall of the West brings a whole new dimension of understanding.  To have it delivered in such an accessible and enjoyable format can only add to the experience.

One notable point gleaned from this comprehensive overview is the challenges that were faced by this society at all times.  The weight of conquest on a political system designed to govern a small Republic; the great civil wars and strife at the end of the Republic; the decadence and lunacy of the first imperial dynasty; the ossification of the education system and the upper echelons of society you highlight during the golden age of the Antonines; the anarchy of the middle 3rd century; and the lurching from instability, to competent individual Emperor, and back, in the late empire.  Perhaps the question we should ask is not "why did the West fall?", but "why did the Empire last so long, given all the reasons it should not have?".

I am sad that this has come to an end, but I await the new project with keen anticipation.  You could do the history of the lands of the Western Empire to the present day - with the over thousand years you have already covered you are more than a third of the way there!

"On May 6th 2012,Fancoise Hollande was elected President of France.  He has been President for 3 days, or minus 4, depending on whether we count from his election or his inauguration..."

Any way, I have been ranting enough.  The best of wishes to you, Mrs History of Rome, and your new addition!  Thank you again.  Until the next time...

Thank you so much Mike! At state school in England we didn't spend much time on the history of Rome, the history lessons were all very much 'on message' about Oliver Cromwell and the various Kings and Queens of England (ad infinitum). I always wanted to go back some day and learn about what Romans ever did for us and you've provided a fantastic way for me to do this. I have enjoyed every episode. I'm a proud dad to a 3 month old daughter and it's a wonderful experience...tiring but wonderful.  Best wishes, Antony

I've been listening you for the longest time. And to be honest, I'm more that a little sad the it has come to an end.  I've actually have been unable to listen to the last four because I don't want it to end.

You did an amazing job and I appreciate all the time and effort you put into this podcast.  I wish you all the best in the future.

Dear Mike
A huge thank you for your efforts in producing your magnum opus. Like so many others, I discovered this only recently (4 months ago) and have listened absorbed during my daily commute (in Hong Kong), only to reach the end just as you do.
As one who grew up in the shadow of the Antonine Wall, I have long been interested in Roman history but only had a faint knowledge of it. Now I have become a real Roman bore thanks to you and often ask myself, "What would Cicero say/do?" when faced with a moral dilemma.
Good luck with your new family and thank you once again. I urge everyone who has enjoyed this podcast to make a donation.
with warm personal regards
Frank

Riding my bike along the shore looking over the Indian Ocean, listening to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire.

I have enjoyed your podcast so much over the past two years or so. I have learned a lot, but am sure there is an enormous amount yet to learn. You made so many mundane activities incredibly enjoyable and edifying. You also gave my friends a lot of fodder to make fun of me with. But anyway, when the rest of the senate and I meet to vote on your deification I will most certainly vote "Yes".

Lacking words to describe how gratefull and impressed I am to this podcast, which has been a favourite since I first got into it at around episode 30 or so. Understandable that it now ends, but I am sure Mike will get an itch and start another podcast with history topics. Once the sleep depravation of the baby times ends:-) As a father of two young boys I have also had a tendency to fall asleep while listening to the podcast, which now makes me glad that I can relisten to the whole thing from the start and still discover new things.
A sincere thanks to you Mike, for the numerous hours you have shared with us followers. Good luck with the baby!

Mr. and Mrs. History of Rome,

Thank you for your time, thought, and dedication. I found THOR in the fall of 2008. I had just moved to Montana to start my dissertation work. I was lonely and feeling sorry for myself. I decided to download a podcast or two and go for a long walk. I discovered two things that day: 1) my new town 2) The History of Rome. I have been a diligent listener ever since and am a better person as well as scholar for it. Thank you again and good luck.

In the time our Roman Empire has risen and fallen I have got married and had 2 kids. THoR has been with me all the way. It has given me an interest and a love of history I didn't know I possessed until I started listening. Words don't express my gratitude enough to you Mike, but thank you, thank you so much for your sacrifice and the labour that so evidently goes into the work you have created.

I can't wait for my kids to join the journey in the years to come. If you ever do a family friendly tour, I'm booking! (cd too!).

I wish you the very best for your family.

(podcast about sleepless nights and fatherhood?!)

All the very best

I've been a long time listener since around the episodes when Rome was getting repeatedly trounced by Hannibal. I've always had an intesrest in Antiquity (my BA in history 25 years ago concentrated on classical studies) so I've been enjoying these immensely. I'm sure it has been very demanding, but as Virgil said "One day, we will look back upon these things with joy". Great job!

Hi Mike

I just wanted to say a massive thank you....its been emotional, you have been a weekly constant in my life for so long, I was genuinely a little choked up over the final episode, although we have never met It felt very much like I was saying goodbye too a good friend.

I hope all goes well with your baby boy -I have a little girl who's just turning 2 - and can tell you from  experience that you are all in for a truly incredable time.

Stay frosty and again a huge thanks.

I, like everyone else here want to also say thank you for the last couple years. I'm a farmer in Iowa and I picked up the podcast around episode 80 when I was looking for things to listen to with all my time spraying and combining in the spring and fall. Each spring and fall I would start back over at episode 1 and listen up to the current episode again. I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute I've spent listening and learning. Because of you I now have a map of the Roman Empire framed above my desk and I still enjoy looking at it and thinking about all the history that has happened.

While I'm sad your finished, I am also extremely grateful your ending on a high note. Thanks for all the great podcasts and information you brought in a clear concise manner.

Only one thing: If you ever come to Southern Spain, especially Almeria, Granada or Seville, make sure to send an email and we´ll take you out for some tapas and a few drinks!

Best wishes for the future and enjoy your baby boy. Life changes with kids, but it is more than worth.

Hi Mike, thank you for the incredible podcast, you really brought the history to life. Before I discovered the show 1 year ago I was not particularly interested in history but now it is the complete opposite. I will continue with the "The Persian Empire" from the 'The Great Courses'
company, they do quality stuff, but I doubt it will be as good as what you did. You've made the right combination of facts, action, humour and soul and that's why I think this is one of the best things out there!! Best wishes to you and your family.

I discovered your podcast sometime last year and have been listening like crazy to catch up!

As someone who has never enjoyed history in any format, I can honestly say that THoR flung the doors of the past wide open for me! I have recommended your podcast to all my friends and family as a MUST DOWNLOAD!

Also, as someone who has recently gotten married and returning to school I understand the need to let THoR end, especially with the baby, CONGRATS!

I will be looking through the classical courses at school come next semester, that is all because of THoR and for that I say THANK YOU.

Looking forward to your next podcast, all the best. -Dusty

I started listening seven months ago from the first episode onward. I was short by 30 episodes to get caught up when you posted the last one! My own two cents as to how great your podcast is/was is basically this: in the middle between baser and esoteric concerns, human motivations from distant history can be hard to make full sense of, and your podcast made the Roman way of thinking accessible in plain, transparent language. The players from this era really came alive! As an Italian-American, I owe you twice as much thanks for filling in this massive blank for me, and I will be moving on to the "Decline and Fall" after I finish out the last episodes. By the way, there are other stories later in history about the Italian state and its reformation - though I realize you have other projects in mind. Perhaps the story of Garibaldi might be interesting? I think he was a contemporary of Machiavelli, I'm not entirely certain...

(PS: Who knows what could happen 5 or 10 years down the road, maybe you all of a sudden want to do a podcast on something again? I'm sure there's a horde of people who'd come running to it if we only knew about it... make sure you spread the word widely if it happens!)

Anyway: Thanks again.

Mike, a huge thank you. I got hooked not long after listening to Lars Brownworth's podcasts on the Byzantines and the Normans.
I'm going to miss that little guitar sting at the front and back of every show! Can't say how much the podcast has meant to me - the winding story, the jokes, the metro-nome like tick of it week by week in my life (with a few gaps!)giving me something regular and reliable to enjoy in my chaotic world. I could listen to it all over again, but I've done that twice already - once during the 'hiatus' and once during the tour breaks!
Over the years I got 4 others hooked on it and am not sure if they'll donate the tenner your requested, so please find it (in Aussie dollars! They're at parity right now!) in your donations box. Worth every cent.
I'll look forward to your next venture, best of luck with the family.

I wanted to let you know what I have done to scratch my Roman history itch, so to speak. For reasons I won't go into, I have two iPods. One has been dedicated to my favourite podcasts. I have every episode of The History of Rome on that iPod. You've given us a wealth of information. Thanks and best wishes for the future. :)

Another note of thanks Mike. I've been listening for 5 years now (almost since the podcast started).

It's been a ritual to listen to THoR followed by Melvyn Braggs "In Our Time" on my (very early) Monday morning drive to work in rural Australia. It'll be a strange break with reality to listen to something different instead.

It's been a pleasure, I've learned a lot, all the best for the future.

What a fantastic achievement. I only found History of Rome last January, so that most episodes were available. Some days I listened to 5 or 6 episodes at a stretch. My wife felt that she has become a History of Rome widow.

Due to my late arrival I could not join one of your tours, but have just returned from a two week tour of Italy. Your podcast made Rome so much more interesting.

All the best with the baby, and like all of your other fans I am looking forward to your next pod-casting venture.

Hi, Mike. I'm a truck driver in Los Angeles. First off, I would like to thank you ofcourse;  tell you that I dig your style in podcasting ( formal, yet hip), and that when ever I heard the opening guitar strum to your podcast it was as if I traveled back in time and lived the episode. Sooo-10xs better than reading a book.

 I think I've found a better understanding of everything around me and how it came to be: I mean it all clicks, it makes perfect sense: Rome ( Trajan, theodocius, laws, codices, military)  to the German Vandals & Visigoths ( aleric, stilico aetius)- to kingdom of Spain (carthage, hannibal,Feudal system, Spanish language)- to the conquest of the new world ( Habsburg, then Bourbons, Latin America , California), Christianity ( council of nicea, Arianism, catholics, popes, the structure of the catholic church modeled after the roman patres familias, the crusades, inquisition, Christmas) Economy ( inflation, natural resources, grain live stock, taxes, rich and poor, corruption)  etc

Lessons learned;
1)A nation has to be able to change with the times: ( much like Rome did in the 3rd century
2)Exclusion of a people harnesses animosity, if you can't defeat an enemy don't wound him, you will never learn peace ( mithradates, Hannibal, Sassanids, Egypt)  . Fear can get so far, for so long.  Either kill them or defeat them then include them ( Julius Caesar ( yeah Agustus, but he decided to kill everyone)).
2b) If your going to let them live in Rome, and if your going to let them fight for you don't be prejudice and consider them as an " other"
3) War is inevitable- war is economics; because of limited resources ( gold, food, human capital ( taxes, slavery)
4) Religious tolerance is veeeeeery important.
5) Military supremacy is very important but also the ability to garner peace put it together and you get a very nifty stick and carrot.
6) the best king or emperor is that who is empathetic, and gets down and dirty ( Trajan, Sulla, Aurelian)
7)Fixation to the past, or what once was is dangerous especially when it comes to wiggly lines on a map that people get so nostalgic about  ( Datia). Glory is good but it's better when you have vision to still see it standing in the future ( steve jobs). If you need to call it quits-quit during your apex, and just like Mike Duncan's The History of Rome you'll leave a legacy and the respect from many.

Thank you. I've enjoyed your style and humor enormously. The tribute to your grandfather who had a copy of Gibbons available for a fifteen year old was touching. I hope you have parlayed your gift of parlay into something wonderful.

I actually have about 60 episodes to go. Hopefully your next project will be well underway by the time I finish.

Mike, thank you for this amazing series. I started listening 3 years ago and have loved every minute of it.

I recently restarted from episode #1 with my 10 and 13 year old sons on trips in the car. They have been captivated. You've not only taught me everything I know about THoR, but now you're educating my children. I couldn't think of a greater compliment.

Thank you for inspiring my kids to find history cool and fascinating (they're even reading books about it now!).

Thank you all your time, knowledge and sacrifice (thanks to Mrs. THoR too!).

Best of luck on your new adventure.

Definitely the best podcast ever for me. Thanks so much for all the work you have put into this endeavour. It will be a massive hole in my life. I have kept the podcasts for my son. He has listened to one already. Give it six years or so and check out Horrible Histories and great intro to history. He was listening to one about the Gothic non-sack of Rome while I was listening to your episode on same. You will enjoy fatherhood, moments like that are the best.
Am taking a Schrodinger's (apologies, no umlaut) Cat approach to the Final episode - if I never listen to it, I cannot know if it has ended.

Mike,  I came across The History of Rome when I was given an iPod for my birthday nearly three and a half years ago and was searching for interesting things to download.  I was fascinated from the very first.  Many years ago I studied Latin as a language for five years at school (and passed with distinction!).  I learned quite a lot of Roman history while doing so.  This podcast reignited my interest in the period (along with the Roman "Caesar" novels by Collen McCullough).

Thank you very much for your persistence (which resembles that of one E.Gibbon!), erudition, and above all your delivery style.  I have enjoyed every moment of your podcasts and will await with interest what you decide to do next.

It's been a great pleasure, extremely informative and fun. Caught up on everything I have missed in high school and so much more. And it looks like I have no other choice but to start back from the beginning....

Very best of luck to you, and I very much second listener Todd Goldberg - sell the series on CD/DVDs. I will buy them. I already know that my kids will be listening to them. And make a shorter version and sell it as educational material to schools. They will love you - how else can you make high schoolers learn ancient history ;)

Again, many many thanks!

I would also like to add my thanks for a great series of podcasts.
I developed a passion for all things Roman when I was 11 while discovering how Britain became part of 'the empire' and how the region where I live rose up in defiance ( Iceni ). I came across you podcasts in March 2009 when I decided to download the back catalogue for my trip down to Ischia an island in the Bay of Naples. I travelled a day after the earthquake struck L'Aquila, north of Rome and was fretfull as to how the Romans would have read the auspices and what message was being sent by the 'Gods' with the destruction of a town named after the Eagle - sent by Jupiter himself.
I sat looking back at Naples with Vesuvius towering above the city listening to your first podcasts - not wishing for each one to end but at the same time eager to hear the next one. I found you so easy to listen to and enjoyed your sense of humour.
I was not however a weekly follower as I found that you instilled within me a desire to go back to the source records myself and in addition to my already well thumbed penguin classics I have acquired a number from your suggested reading lists. ( currently reading The Poison King ) so I would visit your podcasts periodically begin to catch up and then go back to listen again to a specific event, emperor etc as I got sidetracked by a documentary, new book or news paper article.
I will like the many posts here miss your podcast. I wish you and your family all the best for your future endeavours.

Woe! Woe! And thrice woe! I have been listening for years and wanted it never to end.

You have left us with a wonderful body of work. Your just-right pace and easy yet authorative delivery will continue to attract new listeners for years to come. Well done.

My only thought is, would you consider rerecording some of the earlier episodes? Their technical quality does not do justice to what follows a few episodes later, but as the starting point for new listeners they may be off putting.

Best wishes for all your future projects.

I began listening to your History of Rome last month and I must say that you've got me hooked! Your style of storytelling is as good as it gets, when it comes to keeping the listener interested.

I would be quite interested if you'd do your next project on The Age of Discovery. I believe that between the end of the Black Plague in the 1300s thru the mid-late 1700s were the most interesting times in world history because of the characters (discoverers and their employers) make good storytelling just like the Roman Empire.

Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for a history lesson that was WELL DONE. A great ride indeed.

Thanks.

Mike, thank you for your incredible work on this podcast. As someone who lives in Rome and works as a licensed tourist guide I was incredibly impressed by your attention to detail and your ability to filter the various sources to come out with a really excellent objective commentary on the world of the ancient Romans.

I wish you the very best with the new baby - but when you feel you have relaxed enough (or when Mrs THoR lets you), it would be wonderful if you could turn all that research into a book.... the new Gibbon perhaps!

We never got to meet when you were over in Rome, but do look me up next time you're over.

Best wishes with your new adventure, and the mysterious new podcast.

(I've been hanging around 059 since my projects are set in around end of Republic and Early Empire time periods - though I have snuck up to 86)

So I'm quickly listening to 179, and thought I should comment to say Thank you for all the effort.

It is much appreciated.

One other thing. Will it be British History? I can see that being really cool and even more monumental than Roman History. Though in many ways British History is an offshoot of Roman History. We will see what it winds up being and here is hoping that we don't have to wait too long for your return.

Oh, and congrats on your soon to be born baby. Please make a post when this happens!

Thanks for educating a teacher.

You have created something out of nothing, wealth where the land was barren, increased the quality of life of not just all who have listened, but all who know all who have listened.

You know, after a year or so off, consider coming back and adding extra material to past episodes.   You could squeeze in the material by putting a 'b' on the end of the number.

Take a look at how Bob makes money at 'History According to Bob.'  More is better, consider coming back some day.

Some podcasters cannot decide whether they are historians or comedians.
I reckon you provide a great summary of Rome with just the right kind of light touch.
This is a production designed to inform and entertain the reader, rather than to demostrate the erudition of the author.

There are too few such efforts. A CD version is an absolute essential.

I've used it to soothe myself when I was stuck in unfamiliar hotel rooms, far from home, in Kiev, Moscow, Bogota, Cartagena, Tbilisi, Azerbaijan, and too many other places to remember. Thanks for the humor and the insight. For humanizing this vast stretch of history.

Thanks Mike for your amazing work. I discovered them last year and listening to them on my drive to and from work was a highlight of the day.

I live in Sydney so driving in bumper to bumper traffic is something most sane people would try to avoid, so I'm saying a lot when I say I looked forward to the drive.

You've gotten me interested in history again. Hope you don't take too long to produce the next series.

Sigh....
I have listened to several other history podcasts, nobody else comes close to the quality of THoR.  The delivery is so smooth, so intimate, I wish I could have a private teacher come sit by the fire for all other subjects.  Others sound so much like rote reading of a script while here it was always a conversation.  This could well be Duncan's Magnum Opus, but I hope it doesn't stop you from trying again!  If/when a new series starts (not ancient, not American) I'll definitely tune in again!

I also agree a CD would be an excellent idea, and would be another enthusiastic customer if it is feasible.

Best of luck with your baby, and I can't wait to hear what you have planned next.

Dear Mike,

Thanks so much for your fantastic efforts in delivering the History of Rome. I was never any good at history in my school days, but I always had an interest in it. Your amazing podcast, together with your easy going style of narration, made this so accessible to me over the past two years, and I can't imagine how much I have learnt from it.

Thank you again, and best of luck with History of Rome Junior and the new project. I can't wait!!

Dear Mike

Feel compelled to add to what amounts to almost a litany of thanks and praise.

I only discovered your podcast two months ago, so have been privileged to engage in THoR marathons which - since I have no capacity for delayed gratification - has been a Jupiter- sized blessing.

An historic achievement by a 21st C Gibbon. I have recommended you to several people and I know that my two sons have become hooked. Since their education was little better in substance, if not process, to that offered by the Empire, my greatest gratitude to you is that you are teaching them that history did not, somewhat to their shock, start with their births.

Thank you, and salute

David

Many, many thanks for the hours of entertainment you have given me as I drive my monotonous journey down the M3 (UK) to work.  I am not sure what I am going to listen to now!  You realise you have produced a contemporary classic and that all future students of ancient history will be directed your way?  Read Gibbon and listen to TOHR will be the basic starter in every Classics class.  Can't wait till my kids are old enough to appreciate it and I can listen through again with them.

I hope the little caesar and Mrs HIstory of Rome are both well, and yourself of course.

Mike, what an experience your podcast has been, for you as its creator and for me, for all of us, who followed you. Thank you for your passion and your discipline, for your sense of humor and for humanizing what has traditionally been a topic more skewed towards facelessness (with very few exceptions), caricature (Nero "fiddling," Caligula's horse, etc.) and outright superficiality. Your work has made me want to delve even deeper into history, a subject I once ranked last on my list of favorite classes.

Thank you again. Best wishes in every future endeavor.

I really hope you do another podcast, I suggest Ghengis Khan. I really can't thank you enough for all these hours of listening. I can also tell you that according to swedish historians the Goths came from swedens biggest island Gotland "gothland". The island was the most significant place of trade for the vikings.

I would totally pay for a digital or real book featuring pictures to visualize what your talking about in each episode. If it came with the entire show either on a usb drive or a unique key to download the entire show online, I would pay more even.  Maybe this should go to kickstarter?

I feel strangely sad. I haven't read all 443 comments to this blog entry yet (and I don't intend to) but I expect many others have expressed the same thing. I'm not crying or anything. It is more like I am leaving someplace I loved to be and I know I will never see it again. I know there is a good reason I won't return, but that doesn't make me less sad.

Having found this right near the beginning, I want to thank Mike for becoming part of my life for the past few years. I'm sure many of us long time listeners feel the same as I do, that things won't be the same without that opening guitar piece and the beautiful journey through time that always followed it.
I've listened in bed, in the car and even walked to work in good weather - setting off early so I can catch up, when I've fallen behind due to work - and it has always been a pleasure. Business problems barred me from being unable to make the HOR trips, but that's one regret out of many, many hours of pleasure.
I also want to thank the HOR listeners for making me aware that I'm far from alone in my hunger for this topic and those too have become a kind of extended family in a way.
I hope you feel as proud of yourself as we feel of your achievement, which will remain a valuable reference point for future curious types. As the HOR becomes part of history itself, we feel proud to have been there while it was actually being made and are surely glad to have made the journey with you. Thanks a lot Mike.

Mike, I enjoyed every episode starting from 1 all the way to 179.  The excellent content and your wonderful wit and sense of humor made for an A-1 podcast.  Many wishes for success in the future with all you do and enjoy every minute with your new baby.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

I'm a 27 year old Londoner and I learnt more through this podcast than I did studying Classical Studies at University. It's an awe inspiring thing that you've achieved here and you are, in many ways, a hero of mine for the depth and clarity of intelligence and expression that you have.

Congratulations on everything you've done with this - the other commentators were right, there isn't a single bad episode and I can quite honestly say I enjoyed every minute. What a guy!

What am I going to do without your podcast Mike? Thank you for sharing all your knowledge and research with us weekly. We'll definitely miss you (also I've always been just a little behind, but I've been a subscriber since almost the very beginning). I guess I'll have to start listening from the beginning again!

Hi Mike, I know I'm a little behind the times but I Just finished listening to episode 179. It really was fantastic and I cant thank you enough for your enormous efforts. My jogging regime, long drives in country NSW (in oz), boring train rides in Sydney etc.. have all been filled with the history of rome, I was a little worried that they'll never the be same after ep179, however, I don't have to worry about that for a while because I'm going back to the start! I tell everyone who'll listen about the podcast and I'm constantly quoting little trivia bits from your history of rome.

I listened to it from about episode 50 to 100, then went back to the beginning and listened from 1 through the end, even the episodes I'd already listened to.  It kept me walking while listening and I lost about 20 pounds!  So good that it took me a long time to find a new history podcast that I could enjoy - you spoiled me, Mike!

Great series Mike.  I just finished the last episode last week.  I know you are busy now but if you ever start up with the Byzantine Empire, I will pick that up in a heart beat.

You mentioned Lars Brownworth's "12 Byzantine Rulers" as an inspiration in one of your earlier episodes.  I think your detailed approach will be a great balance to his podcast.

This podcast has been a real thrill. Thank you so much Mike. I hope the final episode to be an hour long special or something. I was hoping that maybe you would something like you did in the 100th episode. You open up the floor for all our questions and really cleared up a lot of very interesting questions. THAT would really be awesome and give more closure to the series than just the epilogue. I hope I am not asking to much, given that all this information is this fresh in your head.

Your most sincerely fan

Congratulations on your baby Mike maybe the little one will be an heir to the History of Rome and will some 20 years in the future will take the History of the Eastern Empire.

Your series has been one of my highlights of the week for 2 years now. It helped with my commute to a job a hated. Anyway I have started a project that is really a homage to you. Its not yet on iTunes, I will do that this week but episode 1 "bigs you up" <a href="http://www.howjamaicaconqueredtheworld.com/2012/02/17/jamaican-independence-1962/">http://www.howjamaicaconqueredtheworld.com/2012/02/17/jamaican-independence-1962/</a>

Boy, I'm going to miss this podcast. I already was a big Roman history fan before I started listening near the beginning of its run, but your podcast really managed to kick my interest in the subject into overdrive! Like, to the point where I'm seriously considering pursuing a Ph.D in history. We'll see how that ends up playing out, but in the meantime, thanks for stoking the flames of my history nerddom so effectively, Mike! (and giving me something to distract myself with at the gym)

Congrats on the incoming little squirt, and I hope he/she is blessed with your love of learning!

As incredibly bummed out as I am right now, I thank you for your effort, Mr. Duncan.

Thanks so much, and good luck to you, the Mrs., and the new kiddo.

Combine this with a love for ancient Roman history, and you can see how you podcast really enriched my life.  I shall be coming back to it frequently.  How about this:  Would you consider producing a, let's say, quarterly podcast about specific topics of Roman history, eg the roman military, social topics, etc.?

It's really reawakened my interest in history and  I now listen to a bunch of history podcasts. Thanks also for your commitment to the series and all the humour you've added in as well.
If you ever decide to do a podcast again (whatever the topic!) I hope you'll email us all or add another post to your blog. I'll keep refreshing the RSS feed regularly hoping a new mp3 appears!!!
All the best to you and your new family - your kid will get some great bedtime stories!

Specifically the Archaeology of late antiquity and the early medieval period. I've even learned Latin since becoming a fan. Your efforts were not at all in vain. Best of luck with the new direction your life is taking

I was shocked to see the words "Romulus Augustulus" in the description of today's podcast; I knew it was coming, but I tried to tell myself it would be a while yet. THoR became my constant companion at about the same time that I learned I have terminal cancer, and catching up gave me a constant source of interest. I was disappointed when I reached "real time," and was even more disappointed that my health prevented me from joining one of the tours. I do wish Mike and Mrs. History of Rome all the best, and I hope young History of Rome proves to be a chip off the old block. I think I'll go back to the beginning and start listening all over again! Thanks again, Mike; the trip has meant a lot to me.

Thank you so much for the time, dedication, and energy you devoted to bring this podcast to us. I'm not venturing into new territory by telling you how much I have enjoyed listening all these years. Your humor was such a nice complement to an interesting story that I hadn't taken an interest in until I found "The History of Rome." There's not a chance that I would've picked up Gibbon had it not been for this podcast.

Many congratulations to you and "Mrs History of Rome."

I just want to add my thanks. This podcast has been fantastic and very much enjoyed by me and the others I have introduced to it. I am disappointed that this won't be popping up in my iTunes every week but also very thankful that you saw it through.

Good luck with the child and whatever it is you go on to do

Thanks again mate.

Mike I've been listening to your podcast for 5 years now(found it when I searched from history podcasts on iTunes when I was 15, I'm 20 now). Your podcast has been one of the things I look forward to the most weekly for a while now. We'll all miss your podcast very much. Good luck with the kid and life.

It's temping to say something trite like "words fail to convey what your podcast has meant to me" but in retrospect, it is kind of like that to see you go.  An episode of History of Rome was usually perfectly timed for a standard commute and would hold my interest for the entire journey.  I started listening right around the time of Vespasian so I started off in area that I kinda sorta knew and was delighted to learn a LOT more about Roman history, roughly once a week, from your podcast.  Thank you, sir, for all your effort and creativity with HISTORY OF ROME, and my best wishes for you in your impending fatherhood.  I hope someday (when your baby starts sleeping nights regularly) you might consider returning to the microphone again.  Best of luck.

In an era of witless YouTube videos and twitter mania, this podcast has been a shining example of what the web can do well. Sincere thanks for an informative, irreverent and always entertaining journey. Word of mouth led me to this podcast in January 2012 and it's been a daily pleasure, sometimes twice daily, since then.  Thanks so much Mike, and congratulations.

Thanks, I have enjoyed your podcast enormously. I have many favourite episodes but Cannae (23b) and Aurelian (117) are my top two. I have followed the podcast for a few years and think of it as an old friend now. Knowing it is over is sad but all good things come to an end. Enjoy family life, kids are a hoot, I wouldn't be without mine.

Thanks again. Sit back, survey your work and allow yourself a satisfied smile. You've educated and entertained so many.

Take care.

Mike,
I want to thank you for all the hard work and entertainment that you have provided over the past few years. I started listening to this podcast midway through my freshman year of high school and now I am about to graduate from high school. The History of Rome has been one of the highlights of my high school career and is one of the biggest reasons that I am going to major in history in college. I really cannot thank you enough and I wish you and Mrs. The History of Rome the best with your new child. I hope that you will be able to do that epilogue episode, but if not I still appreciate all your hrad work.
Thanks once again,
Parker

He studies Latin in middle school and we have a decent drive to/from school, so we have a perfect opportunity to listen and have greatly enjoyed The History of Rome. Thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge and for the quality of the programming.  We will continue to listen our way through Roman History!  Thanks again and best of luck to you.

Mike,

Thanks again for this incredible podcast. Congratulations on the new baby but I do hope you might have that one more podcast episode in you before the final farewell. If so, love to hear your thoughts on the following questions:
1. Did you change your opinions on any of the great figures of Rome during your research?
2. What saved the Eastern half of the Empire from destruction in the late 400's, better leadership, better education, stronger economy?
3. What are your favorite books or audio books dealing with Ancient Rome?
4. Any recommendations for great historical podcasts?
5. Who was the greatest military commander Rome produced?

Best of luck to you, the Mrs History of Rome and the new baby. I'll be revisiting these excellent podcasts for, hopefully, years to come.

Mike, I wish you well. Your podcast has been my faithful companion on my iPhone for as long as Ive had the thing. I never wrote or did more than 5 stars you. I thought about what you had said, told ALL my friends and family and made them listen too. After all Rome went through, to see it end this way... it really is a whimper, and sad.

I only have one negative comment for you so stop now if you like. I dont mind. But I wish your last words were a little less harsh sounding however accurate. I guess I was hoping for a Good Bye with a smile, but, you have a new life coming at any minute and one day when hes old enough, I hope you will continue the History of Rome in some way, moving on into the History of Europe perhaps. Take care.

Mr. Duncan

I've been on board since the Samnite wars.  Over the years, I've dropped every podcast except yours.  We've never met, but your voice is so familiar I'd recognize it anywhere, like an old friend.

Though my undergrad degree is in Classics, I was pretty weak on everything after Marcus Aurelius.  It was a pleasure to have you fill in the gaps for me.

If you publish a CD or audiobook, I'll buy one for me, one for my son, and half a dozen more for half a dozen folks I know who would love it.

I've not had a chance to make it on to one of THoR tours, so I hope those will resume after a while.  Also, maybe we can tempt you to pick this up again, once the little one is in kindergarten.  Seems like a long way off now, but it'll be gone in a flash.

In the meantime, your priorities are in the right place.  Oh, and get lots of sleep while you still can.

Cheers,

Ken Sibley

Mike,
Thank you for your hard work and dedication. I can't say enough good things about your podcast. I have been following THoR since around the Punic Wars (2008-ish). You efforts have fed my interest in antiquity AND have exemplified the positive potential of the internet. You touched lives of professionals and eased their workday commutes as well as you inspired high school students to delve into history. I truly appreciate your efforts. Also, as a parent of two young children I wish you the best. Our son was nearing 19 months old when I started listening to THoR. Your podcast gave me 20 to 30 minutes of wonderful historical retreat every week as we raised our son through the "terrible twos" and as we added a daughter to our family in 09. I look forward to the epilogue and I wish you all the luck in the world.
Thank you again.
- CJ

What's most impressive is that this project was finished.  How many podcasts... hell, how many creative endevours of any kind make it to the end of the line with no compromises and the stated goal completed.  Writing in front of an audience expecting a few more pages every week is no easy feat; and to keep it up for years on end and hit the finish line with your head held high is damn impressive.  Congrats!

Ahh well.  One more to go.  I suppose in calmer times this episode could have been split up in to 2 or 3 podcasts, but you do what ya have to do.

I think I will enjoy going back to the start.  Sometimes THOR could be a jumble of names that fly on past too quickly.  So let's watch the movie a second time to pick up all the bits I missed.

So sad that this has come to an end, but incredibly grateful for the ride. I have been a listener since I was a college sophomore (I'm now two years out, so it has been a while). It is a superb piece of work, and my favorite podcast by a long way. Like the Roman Empire, I don't know if anything will ever top it.

Congrats and best of luck with the baby. Thank you so much.

Most especially, thank you for bringing such a positive experience to the world for all to share.  You brought the ancient world alive through a medium that did not even exist a generation ago.  THOR will always be your "other baby".  Congratulations to you and your family on your new addition!

Mike like others thank-you very much. The podcasts are so enjoyable. My wife and I like to listen to them on car trips. I also listen when I lift weights. You have given me a great gift. It is sad that it is ending but I'm very happy the impending birth. Fatherhood is a great thing. You get the opportunity to reveal the world to your child. Just think you can be the first one to tell your son about the Rubicon. Again thank-you so much. I'll miss new episodes of THoR but continue to enjoy reruns on my iPod.

Your work represents the highest order of public service for benefit of education.  Wait...that sounds too formal...let me put it another way:  Over the past three years, you have been nothing short of Sandy Koufax from 1963-66 (or was that Aurelian? I'm not sure...;-)

Thanks so much for all you've done to enrich our lives.

I think I speak for all of us when I say that we think of you as a friend, even though I wouldn't know you if you walk in my house, and we would enjoy it if you could find a couple of minutes to post some news about your life and stay in touch with us right here.

Let me add one more "gratias maximus tibi ago". It's been a wonderfully educational but light long walk down the Via Appia. I listened to most of these while out on my daily run.

I'll probably start at the beginning - it got a bit confusing with all the emperors after Titus. Anyway - thank you.

Job well done!! Bravissimo!!! Every episode's a joy. I'll keep subscribing to the podcast - just in case there's The Epilogue. I like the idea of further occasional topic-based episodes e.g. what was/were the turning point in Rome? Was The Fall inevitable? Source materials - what's reliable & what eras do we really not have a clue? Romans vs Christians. Romans vs Jews. Rome vs the provinces. etc... All the best for the future!!

Over the past 3 years I've dealt with my mother's illness and death.  This podcast was a faithful companion in the 4 hour journey to see her and later clear out the house.
She was the one who got me interested in Roman history and it was fitting that I listened to this while travelling the Roman roads of Scotland and England and crossing Hadrian's Wall
Thank you

I started listening to the podcast about two months ago, starting with the very first.  I caught up to the current postings only to hear that it was about to end.  I'm glad to have found it before it was too late!

You write clearly and well and I appreciate your kind of humor.  It has been a pleasure listening. I had not studied much Roman history before listening but am inspired to read further.  I admire the discipline this podcast has taken, but it sounds like you have had as much fun making these episodes as I have had listening to them.  Thanks for all the hard work and for the gift of an ongoing interest in this era of history.

I have been enthralled by the twists and turns you have so patiently covered. Previously I had concentrated almost exclusively on the early imperial history but you have led me into entirely new fields, for that thank you. Your knowledgeable and insightful story telling (coupled with a quirky sense of humour) has made the entire journey a joy. Thank you for you effort and I sincerely hope that you understand how many people have had their lives enriched by your work. Now all I need to do is get my kids to sit down and listen to a few episodes and understand what I keep raving about!

All good things must come to end, and so it will be with my History of Rome podcast experience. What will I do each Sunday night when it’s time to download THoR podcast. Well it’s good that I still have all the episodes of THoR. So Mike, I want to say thank you for the many wonderful hours of your podcast. I want to wish the best for you and your new family. Let us end this podcast with bang and not in whimper, as Romulus Augustulus exited stage left of world history. Again think you, Mike and God bless.

I know everyone's saying how well you've done and everything, but try as I might I can't describe how personal, informative and awesome this podcast has been to me for the last 2 and a half years.

Every monday with a podcast was a joy and even two weeks without one was unimaginable torture.

I've listened to this podcast from beginning to present about 4-5 times and every time felt special.

You said during the episodes on the Punic wars when you started that you wanted to condense the roman story into easy to follow bits that people could understand and you achieved that goal spectacularly.

Good luck with all your future endeavours, especially the little one on the way.

Hoping for one last wrap up, but if the baby comes sooner (as they don't tend to ask us when it would be convenient)... Congratulations!

Oh and last of all thanks for the giggle with the "Livia did it."

It has been great to listen to this podcast these last few years. It kept me company on many lunch breaks at both school and work and broke up the monotony of both. For that I can not thank you enough.

In honor of the end of the story of the Empire I had a glass or two of wine while I listened to the last whimper of Western Rome. I will be sure to enjoy a good cup of tea for next week's, or at least hopefully next week's, discussion of what it all means.

Good luck to you, your wife, and your soon to be new child. You've left him/her something wonderful to look back on when the time comes.

I have followed you through the bad audio, the addition of audible, and even the addition of the Mrs. History of Rome.  Though I have never met you, you will be sorely missed.

Congratulations again!

Mike, It's been five years now, hard to believe, that you've been brightening my weeks with your wonderful podcast.  You have rekindled my love for the ancient world, dormant since undergraduate days in the early 1980s.  You have succeeded where I previously failed in getting my wife as interested as I have been in the history of the Roman empire.  You have brought pleasure and enlightenment to so many of your listeners.  You can be truly proud of your achievement.  I hope you will produce another podcast - you are a brilliant broadcaster.    I very much hope you'll continue with the HoR tours - with a young family they weren't possible for us up to now but they sound wonderful. As the father of 3 boys, the eldest now just a teenager, I can confidently say that life will never be the same again for you and Mrs History of Rome.  Parenthood is a truly  wonderful experience, and I wish you and your family joy.

I was hoping 476 would never get here. Mike, your podcast has been the standard for history podcasts. Most every Sunday night I would remember that a THoR podcast would be waiting for me Monday morning and I would actually look forward to getting into work. And the other Sunday nights I would remember you said no podcast was coming and feel the old dread of Monday morning.

I think your Day in the Life podcast was the best. Still love your Vespasian and Aurelian shows. You actually sounded sad when telling us Aurelian was murdered.

One thing I'd love to know, either in the epilogue or from a listener here, did the Roman world at the end look and feel more like a medieval world or the ancient Roman? Were emperors dressed like King Henry or Augustus? Did they still wear laurels or did they wear crowns?

Mike,
I started listening about 2 years ago.  At the time, I was traveling to Italy regularly for work, and the podcast helped me better appreciate some of the areas I would travel through and provided a familiar, friendly (English-speaking) voice.

You have done a great job with the podcast, and it became something that I looked forward to each week.

More recently, it became a bond with my 9-year-old son.  One morning in the fall I put it on while driving him to an early morning hockey practice.  I figured he would fall asleep and not care what I was listening to.  However, you captured him immediately, and it has been something we have listened to and talked about every week now during that drive.

With the birth of your son, my wish is that you too will find things to share with him and to bring you together, whether it is the history of Rome or some other unexpected thing.  Thank you so much for this surprising gift.

I started listening to the History of Rome about two months after the first Podcast, and like most here I've been glued to it ever since. At the time of first listing to THoR I was living in Trestevere, Rome (Mike we'll forgive you your pronunciation), I then moved to Saudi Arabia, with one day off a week ThoR was the highlight of my week.

I and I'm sure others recall the dreadful 'Hiatus' and then the joy when THoR resumed.
I left Saudi Arabia and am now listening in from Thailand.

THoR has been a line of continuity in my life since since 2007 - Thoroughly enjoyable and always eagerly awaited.

We have a long weekend here, so I'm making preparations to listen on Monday - I have a good bottle of wine and I'm going to buy in some dried hams and olives tomorrow.
I'm going to lock the door, take the phone off the hook and and enjoy the end of an era.
Thank you Mike, your hard work has been deeply appreciated.

Mike,

I am usually not one to post reviews or comments, but I couldn't let the end of this fantastic podcast pass without adding my adulations to the already immense mountains of praise posted here for you.

THoR is the standard against which I measure all other podcasts. I've been listening for a few years and loved it when I could enjoy marathon sessions of the backlog. Finally getting up to date was thrilling (feeling more in community with you and other listeners) tempered by the angst of having to wait for new episodes. You didn't just impart the facts, you entertained me, you educated me, you made me laugh. My two favorite bits were the reference to the Battle of Hoth during a description of a battle from one of the Punic Wars (I think, that episode was a long time ago) and the Day in Life type episodes, particularly the Christmas episode which I listened to late at night in bed on a hot summer's night (hooray for an immense archive!). And, my favorite person of note who I hadn't learned about before was Scipio Africanus. For some reason, you made him sound rather hot.

I'll truly miss not learning more history from you every, but I'll still probably fall asleep to your voice many, many more times as I go back to the beginning and listen for hours on end. Plus, I'll be waiting for any future podcasts you care to do, particularly on the topic of American history that you mentioned some time ago.

Best of luck to you and your soon-to-be newly expanded family. You are the best friend that I've never met!

Hi Mike,

I’ve listened to your podcast the past 9 months, and something I looked forward to during my Monday commute. It was absolutely amazing, and I’ve been hooked ever since the very first episode I heard.

Like all the listeners, I was sad it was the very last one and hope to hear from you one last time next week.

Good luck to you, and look forward to finding out whatever your next endeavor will be.

Just wanted to drop a quick note of thanks for you and your body of work. I've got no idea what would possess someone to start such an ambitious project but to actually complete it! Personally I’m glad you did! You gave me an opportunity to fall in love with something that you have loved.

All the best for the future and thanks for again.

Thank you, Mike, for your tour of the Roman Leviathan. It has become, by far, my favorite podcast, and woe unto those who misrepresent Roman history in my presence. And while I will truly miss listening to the podcast every Sunday evening, I feel as though I am losing more than that, as though I am saying goodbye to a friend. So, goodbye friend, at least until we meet again...

Thanks for the literally hundreds of hours of listening and re listening to one of the greatest stories ever told, told by a truly great storyteller.  What about a last episode, considering the causes of decline of the ROman empire. We all know, of course, that livia did it! What are the chances of that!

Being commenter #160 or so, you might not get to this for a while given the events in your life! Congratulations and best wishes! I have enjoyed every single episode and I thank you wholeheartedly for doing this. It was the first podcast I subscribed to when I got an Ipod in 2008, so I'm not quite as long-term as some others - but at least pre-Imperial. I can't really add any originality to what's already been said, so I'll echo: I am (selfishly) sad to see it end, but extremely grateful that you did it, and I will miss this podcast very much. Finally, thanks for enlightening me to the wonderful prose of Edward Gibbon - it's hard, but worth it. Very best wishes for your future endeavors! - Andy

It's just fascinating that here we are merely 10 years away from the END of the Western Roman Empire, and we've had two episodes about serious attempts at a resurgence that might have grabbed a fair chunk of it back.  Admittedly it would have been a hybrid Gothic-Italian affair, but if it had worked, poor Mike Duncan would have had another hundred episodes to fight through.

I don't know what your plans are, but I would like an episode about how the Empire changed the course of history in Europe even after its decline, key points only of course. An example might be attempts by others to unite the continent under one ruler, Hitler, Napoleon, the Hapsburg family; or even the establishment of the EU. I wonder if the goals of the EU would be possible without the historical foundation many of the nations (not all) adopted from their exposure to the Empire. How much of the expansion of the colonial era by countries like France and England, was modeled on Rome's expansion? Without a common tradition of language, law and culture, could Europe have remained a backwater civilization on the global stage?

Anyway, just a thought. I am thankful for all that you have done.

Of course no one (excepting maybe Mike) want this to end - my suggestion is to go do some supplemental podcasts that dive into some of the tangents such as social issues, etc that maybe you chose to skip as you were powering through the 1000 year history.

You could number them Podcast 91a to show where they belong in the chronology.

You did a few episodes covering trying to cover the everyday persons life, the evolution of the armies fighting tactics, etc. - maybe some of those could be done for different periods of time. I am sure there are some other topics that would be great supplements to this fantastic walk through the history of this great empire.

I recently read a book called "The Ruin of the Roman Empire." The book attempted to make the point that Rome did not fall until Justinian's war destroyed the city while reclaiming it for the Empire. It was a controversial conclusion.  I'm not plugging the book, I'm just sharing my thoughts that the book offered a nice review for the history of the western empire just after 476.  I'll be sad to see the podcast end, but maybe we can look forward to the possibility of reading or hearing future works on other topics from Mike.

I'd like to see Mike do a final assesment of the emperors. Back in ep 130 or so he listed:

Best: Augustus, Diocletian, Trajan, Constantine, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Vespasian, Aurelian, (Claudius)

Worst: Commodus, Caligula, Caracalla, Nero, Elagabalus

And to plug myself, anyone wanting a free poster-sized chart of (1) the emperors or (2) the republic can download them from charts.archsoc.com. Great references, if I say so myself.

I agree that Mike should look into academia--if he hasn't already.  He would make the perfect professor because he does something that great teachers struggle to do for their whole lives:  he encourages his audience to realize that there are lost worlds in the pages of history books, worlds that teem with as much life and event and character as a supermarket tabloid.  Was I the only one who thought that the events covered in this week's podcast would make great fodder for an HBO miniseries?

I started out listening to the History of Rome as a dabbler in history, eager to fill in the blanks left by my education.  Now, as the podcast is wrapping up, I'm embarking on the long road of being a history prof.

I loved the story today, and so wrote up my own post about the Battle of Cape Bon: <a href="http://bmackie.blogspot.com/2012/04/was-ancient-roman-911-inside-job.html">http://bmackie.blogspot.com/2012/04/was-ancient-roman-911-inside-job.html</a>

I would love an episode discussing the transition from the fallen Western Empire in 476 to the medieval kingdoms we know and love - France, Germany, England, Spain, etc - circa 800. But that is probably well outside the scope of this podcast.

More on topic, what exactly prevented folks like Aetius or Ricimer from taking the title Augustus for themselves? Rome had had foreign emperors before, and it's not like Majorian or the others had any strong dynastic claims.

Also, why was there never a serious attempt to go back to the republican structure that existed prior to the Empire, ala Gladiator? Especially once Italy becomes isolated, it seems as if the remnants of the old patrician families in the Senate might want a greater say in their government rather than giving their allegiance to a string of barbarian kings such as Ricimer and Odoacer.

I heard your podcast recently saying you were drawing it to a close for perfectly good reasons. I just want to say what an incredible influence you have been on my life. After studying Ancient history at university I got carried away by life and forgot about my passion for it. Since finding your podcast many years ago and making it a cornerstone ritual of my weekly life I have rediscovered that passion, I've read so many books, have visited Greece, numerous Roman sites in the UK and am finally planning my trip to Italy. It is awe inspiring to me that someone would give so much of their time and energy to rekindle an essential part our history in people he has never met. So I say Thankyou Mike Duncan, a deep and almost teary thankyou for everything you have done.

I just wanted to say that I recently listened to the episode where you announced that the show is coming to an end. It felt like friend announcing he was leaving to move far away.

I came to the series late which meant The History of Rome was a constant companion on my commute for around 6 months. Once I had caught up it was a shock to the system to fall back to just 1 show a week.  Checking late Sunday night or early Monday morning to see if the show is up has become a highlight of the week.

I wish you and Mrs History of Rome all the best on impending parenthood.  I'm just over 3 years into father hood and it changes EVERYTHING.  But in a good way or at least you tell yourself that :-)

You will be missed.

I imagine that most Romans who thought about this sort of thing figured that it was only a matter of time before everything got put back together again; that the glory of Rome would be their's once again.

I take issue with one thing that Mike says every week- that Audible is the leading source for audio entertainment. They may have the most breadth of content but for my money, The History of Rome podcast leads as a source for entertainment :-)

I just found out about your podcast 6 months ago, and since that time, I have been furiously catching up - thanks to a recent move with much unpacking required, I managed to FINALLY catch up, just in time for the sad farewell. I took Latin for 4 years in high school, and loved it. This was a great way to realize how much I have forgotten!

I've enjoyed your perspective, humor, and concise extraction of relevant information. In fact, diving into Roman history again also turned me onto Steven Saylor's historical fiction books on life in Rome - there are probably comments or posts about this author previously, but if not, there you go.

Anyway, thanks again and congrats on the upcoming baby! Kids are work, but all sorts of fun. And, I am sure they will someday enjoy all of the the History of Rome podcasts. I sure have.

Best of Luck
Sameer

hey Mike I've been listening to the podcast since the beginning and looking over the titles I found the one name "A day in the Life" I believe this was episode 88, which as we can all see was a very long time ago. So I was wondering that seeing how so much has changed from that period of relative peace in Rome that you would create another "Day in the Life" except what life as like for common romans near the end of the Great Empire. Thanks and have loved the podcast ever since it started. :)

I have really loved the podcast. Your humour and humanity helps the subject really come alive.
I agree with Zack, that there is so much more history that you could do!
However, its your call and you have earned it. I only hope that at some stage, perhaps when you don't need to be doing the late night feeds and nappy (diaper) changes you consider another project. Your fans will still be there.
So long and thanks for evrything,

Mike - what a fantastic podcast!
This was the first podcast I ever properly subscribed to and it's been an incredible journey. I've always been fascinated by the Roman Empire and to methodically go through it's history has been just awesome. It's hard to imagine what they may have achieved if the leaders hadn't spent so much time slaughtering each other!
As a VP in a large telecoms company it also reminds me of corporate politics. Thanks goodness we don't carry weapons any more!!
I now listen to many other podcasts but for me yours is the gold standard. When I wake up Monday morning for work the first thing I do before breakfast is start downloading the latest weekly update on iTunes. So the end of an era approaches!
Having your first child will be an enlightening experience. But I have a hunch that after a while you will hanker for a new project.
I really hope you find a subject that captures your clear enthusiasm in the same way as the Roman Empire.
How about the History of Britain? A fascinating little island that once had an empire even bigger than the Roman Empire if not as long lasting.....
Whatever you do I wish you success and say thanks for all those fantastic episodes.
Scipeo Africanus - you Rocked!
All the best / Jerry UK

Man I have been along this ride for a while and I hate to see it end. That said I found this epic Roman battle in the news.

<a href="http://now.msn.com/now/0413-rome-police-centurion-battle.aspx">http://now.msn.com/now/0413-rome-police-centurion-battle.aspx</a>

Quick question is it sad that I prefer Mike Duncan's narration of this event better then some reporters? If anything I think it could have read like;

Next week on The History of Rome. We will learn of the battle of the legions and the barbaric tribe known as the "Italiian Cops". And their battle at the Flavian Colosseum in 2012 AD. :)

I can't recall if this was a prior recommendation or not, but for a history of Rome podcast, it simply can't be missed: The Aeneid as read by Simon Callow.  The translation is wonderful, and its reading is dramatic and engaging.

Also, there's a couple of classical mythology lectures (both for Greek mythology and early Roman myth) available that are wonderfully informative.

Love the podcast.  Sad to know it's wrapping up.  I've been along for the ride since the Gracchi, and have loved every moment since.  I'll be taking a certification test soon to be a Latin teacher, and simply listening to your podcast has made me more than qualified to pass the history portion of the exam.  Thanks for the help! :D

Absolutely superb podcast! Thanks, Mike, for many hours of educational and listening enjoyment. I cannot tell you how much I like these and what a wonderful job you do in so many aspects of Roman history and lecturing. I look at and listen to a lot of podcasts, and this is by far the best. I appreciate all the effort, hard work, brain power, study, and thoughtfulness that goes into each episode.

I am going to wait a few months, and then start listening again starting with episode 1. I find when I listen the second time, I still learn quite a bit.  All the best going forward!! No doubt you will excel and whatever you do.

Thanks with all my heart for all the time and effort you have put in. You are a gentleman and a scholar and I will be sad to lose our strange kind of freindship. Though we are thousands of miles apart, we are of similar age, temperment and humour and I Like to think that should our paths ever cross we would be like Spartacus and Crixus or Octavianan and Agrippa. Ha ha.
Congrats about your boy. My son is six months old now and once he comes you will barely get time to shave let alone podcast. So I hope he doesn't come early. Haha.

Hey Mike! Long time listener, and rare commenter (I think the last time I commented was around episode 40ish). I just want to say thanks for putting out such a great podcast for so long. I remember starting to listen to the History of Rome way back with the Young Julius Caesar Chronicles, when I was still right smack in the middle of High School.

The History of Rome has been one of my consistent pleasures, and I've looked forward to every single episode. In fact, I also owe you my SAT score since I ended up writing the essay portion on tidbits of Roman history I learned from the podcast.

Now that I'm finishing up my first year of college (It really has been a while since the podcast started up, huh?), I'm sad to see the History of Rome begin its final episodes, but its for the best. We've all entered new stages in life, you've got a kid on the way, and I'm now something vaguely resembling an adult.

This comment is now very long and rambling, but I guess what I'm trying to say in so many words is Thanks! It's been a blast. From Catiline all the way to Maximinus Thrax (with more figures on both sides of them), it's been a great time. If you can put so much love and attention into putting out such a great show for all of us faceless listeners, I'm sure you'll be a great dad.

Cheers!
Ore

Was in London at the weekend, and was surprised to find a copy of Trajan's Column in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Seemingly due to pollution damage this 19thC exact copy is now finer than the original. I would still recommend a trip to Rome, but if you can only get to London check it out.

Mike,

Thank you for a fantastic podcast. The sheer epic sweep of what you have created and shared with all of us is astounding.

I hope you can continue to find an outlet for your interest in ancient history. Perhaps a turn at publishing is in your future?

In the meantime, congratulations for your upcoming addition to the family.

As other have suggested, a Q&A session would be great. I would also love to see one or all of the following:

- A description of the lives of everyday Romans (it's been awhile since we've seen that), and how such life shifted from the life of the ancient world to the life of the medieval world. Especially the way in which not only was knowledge lost, but even the memory that such knowledge existed was lost.

- A wrap-up episode, summarizing how the Roman world evolved from beginning to end, and how it influenced the world in its own time and after.

- A summary of how the classical world shifted into the medieval world. Aside from daily life for the common people, it's clear that the world view of medieval elites was fundamentally different from that of their Roman predecessors. And while there's hints of this shift in the podcast dialogue so far (the Italians seeing the Gallo-roman senator, Avitus, as an invading foreign conqueror), it would be great to hear your thoughts on this.

So all of these together would probably take up three to four more episodes. Call it my desperate attempt to squeeze out a little more from your fantastic narrative. But I think these would provide a valuable capstone to your podcast.

All good things come to an end. I was of course sad to hear that the podcast would be coming to an end soon, but it was to be expected. So, first, thank you for a great production.

Second, I have a suggestion for a final podcast after the normal history comes to an end. How about doing a whole episode on books about Rome. I know you've talked about individual ones along the way, but something that brings that together and compares different books depending upon the reader's purpose and goal would be really helpful.

Again, thank you.

Hi Mike,

Long time listener first but first time commenting. With your announcement that you'll be finishing the podcast I just wanted to let you know how much I have loved it. Been listening for several years now and have always found it very interesting and informative and has started an obsession learning about Roman history and history in general. Before your podcast I knew a little about the end of the Republic, a little about Hannibal fighting and the Romans and a little about the Romans in Britain and now I know a huge amount about the span of Roman history.

This has been my favourite podcast for years now and don't know how I will get a weekly fix of excellent history.

You should be extremely proud of what you have created and I hope you find the time to do more things like this.

Rich

Hi Mike,

Just wanted to say a huge "thank you" for all of your hard work. I'm not quite this far yet in the podcast (at the very end of the Late Republic so I'm very happy that I have quite a bit more to listen to) but your podcast has been one of the finest pieces of work I've ever had the joy of listening to. You're a great historian and you'll be an amazing dad. Your podcast made it possible for me to not do the readings for the first half of my History of Rome class that I'm currently taking in college which was wonderful. Thanks so much for everything, and I think I speak for everyone when I say thanks for all the laughs and the best of luck with everything (not that you'll need it).
Best,
-K.

Your voice has traveled with me through living in NYC and San Antonio, road trips back and forth from Texas to St. Louis and will continue to keep me company when tHoR Jr. is graduating high school.  I've listened to the podcasts straight-through three times and will probably revisit them yearly as they provide me with so much joy.

Thank You Mike for this incredible work, and congratulations to you and Mrs. tHoR on the arrival of Baby tHoR Jr.

Mike, thanks for everything. Really, you've done some the best historical writing I've ever heard/read, and I've done a lot. The humor and humanity you've brought to the experience has made it that much more engaging. Really, I think you're something like a Roman Walter Cronkite: everyone looks at you as a friend they invite into there home.

That said, it had to end at Romulus Augustus, going with the Byzantines would have made it into something like The Simpsons: somewhat comforting to see, but really more a sad reminder of what once was.

If I may be bold, a request: any chance we can get a final Q&A show like the 100th episode? And maybe an occasional "Christmas Special" ala British television where there's one off episodes on aspects of Roman culture?

Enjoy your adventures in fatherhood, we all know you'll be a great one.

Thank you again. I've loved listening from the very beginning, and I think you've created something wonderful here. And you've made the right decision -- Romulus Augustulus is the sensible stopping point for this series. The sadness in losing your regular podcasts is offset by anticipating what new things you will do.

Mike, congratulations to you and Mrs.The History of Rome on the upcoming birth of your son!  It is an exciting time for you both!  I hope that you are enjoying your home in Austin.

Though the THoR may be ending, I hope that you will continue the trips to Rome (and hopefully Constantinople again).  I was unable to take any of your history tours because I am getting married in April and recently went to Constantinople (Istanbul) in 2009 and Rome in 2010.  But, I hope to go back.

Thanks for an excellent podcast!  I have listened to THoR since 2008 when I picked up on your podcast shortly after listening to the 12 Byzantine Rulers podcast by Lars Brownworth.  I have enjoyed THoR immensely, and it helped to re-stimulate my long dormant interest in Roman history.

Thanks again!  Enjoy being married and being a dad!

We all knew it would happen one day but I don't think many of your fans have listened to your announcement without a lot of sadness. It's lovely though that the end of one era for you and us is going to be the start of an amazing time for you personally. I first started listening to you when I was pregnant with my first child and now I'm sat writing this whilst holding my second; you've been there for me through night feeds, colic and many a nappy change! Many congratulations to you and Mrs History of Rome, I hope we get to find out whether you've chosen a suitably Roman name for your son? I'll miss waiting for a new episode but will look forward to hopefully one day hearing that you've not been able to stay away from podcasting and have started us on another fantastic journey. Thank you so much Mike and best wishes for the future.

Perhaps when the little guy is a little less of a handful, you might consider revisiting that history of the American Party system you mentioned way back at the start. I for one would love love love to hear that.

I join everyone in congratulations. Please write a book one day. I'm reading "Lost to the West" right now, after listening to the Byzantine podcasts, but that's always been second fiddle to the History of Rome.

A minor request, if you can find time. A recommendation podcast for all us history junkies who won't know what to listed to anymore. I've never found a weekly podcast quite like yours, but maybe you know more that I can't find.

Good luck with everything, and I hope a history of medieval Europe will appear in my podcatcher in 5-10 years.

The HOR taught me about Rome like I never could have imagined Mike.  Every week I look forward to a new HOR. I knew you were ending with the west but at the same time, I had hopes you might go with the Byzantine Empire.
   For five years I've listened to your podcast and loved it.  Now, like me you will be a dad.  I hope you will have a podcast here and there but I understand if you want to call it quits now.  You'll be missed Mike.

By the way, I can say from experience that after the kid gets sleeping through the night life does come back. I wrote a 500 page novel since my son was born.

If you decide to resurrect the podcast someday and take us through Justinian you would be my hero.  (Actually you're already my hero, but you did that we'd throw you a triumph!)

   Meanwhile, Mrs. History of Rome steals away to Ostia, boarding a Constantinople-bound merchant vessel with their infant son, HoR II.

Congratulations on the baby and thank you for the History of Rome.  I only found THoR a couple of years ago, but have listened to every episode, many more than once.

In the last two years you have really become a part of my weekly routine and something to keep me going on a Monday.  I will miss you.

And,to put a bug in your ear based on something you said in an early episode, Simon Schama's History of Britain has gaps that could be filled through a podcast.

I've been a big fan for a long time, Mike, and like everyone else here, there's a lot I'll miss.

Not just the podcast and the information themselves, though of course that's a lot of it, but the clarity of presentation, the occasional asides, and mostly, your sense of humor.

To many, history is old, dry, and boring.  Even for buffs and fans like us, it's too often presented in a stilted manner, of names and dates, "and then this happened."  To say nothing of the mass (and mess) of contradictory source material, biases and flat-out propaganda.

So to have the highlights, the important things, and a few interesting oddities presented and explained in a straightforward and entertaining way-- that's just fantastic.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: Thank you.  Good luck with your new life and your new adventures.  I'm glad we, your audience, still have a little time before the end so we can all let you know how much we've appreciated the work you've done, and how much fun it's been.

Mike, thanks for all you've done for us over the past couple of years.  You've been a staple throughout my University journey and were the inspiration for changing my minor to Ancient History.  I really can't picture what my Monday morning commute will be like without having my Roman history lesson to listen to.

I was really hoping one day you'd pop onto the air and tell us all that you figured a way to make podcasting a full time job and that you'd be with us for many more years to come.

But as other people have stated in the comments, it is the end of an era and I suppose all good things must come to an end. Best of luck with you're child, it's lucky to have such a dedicated and intelligent Father!

I hope one day you'll find the time and are able to share your talents with us again.

Your work inspired me to see Rome for myself (before I caught up to the Tour announcement) and I am sure I will listen to all 170-odd episodes again in the future. Thanks again for your dedication and good luck as you move to fatherhood.

I've been listening since the beginning.  Felt compelled to find some place to say thanks.  History of Rome has been part of my Monday routine at work now for the last four years, and I'm going to miss it.  Look forward to seeing what you've got in store in the future, I'm sure it'll be great.  Best regards.

So many comments:

Firstly, congratulations on the impending pitter-patter of little caligae! Good luck.
Obviously, I'm sad that HoR is ending, I would have liked to hear your take on Justinian and Belisarius. But Romulus Augustulus is the most obvious place to end.

A couple of questions:
Are you sure Galla Placidia was the brother of an emperor?
In what ways did the Roman Empire die when Maximinus Thrax overthrew Alexander Severus?

All the best

Finally, can anyone recommend another history podcast?

Congratulations Mike on your first son!!! I have been a listener since Episode 72 and each week I have looked forward to your podcast. As a history teacher I have to say how much I have enjoyed listening each week. You have made history so enjoyable and accessible that THOR is what history should be. Thank you for the blood, sweat, and tears you have put into this. This podcast re-awoke my love of Roman history. You will be missed greatly. If you ever have another project please let us know!!!! I have been listening to all the old episodes of course and I was on episode 88 "A Day in the Life." Though I doubt there is time I wish we could have an episode that dealt with Roman law, The Games, Sanitation as you said,construction and technology, and some of the other things that made up Roman daily life. That being said it has been one hell of a ride and I could never thank you enough.

Sincerely,
          Jonathan V.

Septimus Severus Duncan.  He will think you named him after a Harry Potter character.

It's been a great run.
You've earned your place with "12 Byzantine Emperors" and "Napoleon 101".  It'll be one of the great podcast series that people will keep on discovering for years to come.   You've told a story, and every good story needs to come to an conclusion eventually.

And now there's thousands of listeners out there about to go Cold Turkey.  We need a new Story Teller.

I discovered THOR two weeks ago and just this morning finished listening to the first 171 episodes. I am devestated to learn that there's only two more. In my opinion, which I know doesn't count for much, this has got to be by far the best podcast out there. I've learned more about Roman history than in five years of high school, and who knows how many wasted hours bumming around wikipedia. Mike, you've put together a spectatular work. Congo-Rats!

(Yes, I said two weeks ago. Yes, 171 episodes. No, I didn't doze off. No, I don't have a life, I do a lot of driving ... a LOT of driving)

Can I be excused now? My brain is full!

Too bad the end of Rome, and of my adventures, is so close at hand. I left Chile, after several years, on the day you did the Adrianople podcast :)

The roman empire died with Alexander Severus because he is the last traditional princeps in the empire, he acted like the first citizen of the romans, not the barrack emperors like Maximian or like the god-like Diocletian and Constantine.

Even thought at the moment I have the biggest sad face then almost anyone here, I do understand. If you kept going, you would have to go into the ottomans, then how far it went, and then the dual monarchy of the ottoman empire and the Austria-Hungarian empire, and so on and so forth until you get to present day, and let's face it, it's not like you'll have all the time in the world. You have a life now, and we, your very faithful listeners, understand. I hope to keep talking to you, as possibly a kind of friend, and if so, my email is raph675@gmx.com, and if not, well I can't really blame you. Well, again, just don't forget to mention which Ostrogoth king sent Romulus to safety, or how his life played out.
And again, thank you so f***ing much man. (';

Mike,

You've unknowingly been my carpool companion for several years and I'm going to miss you as you go on to become a father.  Congratulations!

As a father myself, I'll let you in on a little secret:  The first few months are especially crazy, but then it gets easier as you find your rhythm and your child grows.  Your free time will return, as will your hobbies -- to some extent.  If you wish to pick up the microphone again in the future, you'll find the time.  If there's one thing parenthood has taught me, it's how to prioritize!

Whatever you choose to put into a podcast, I'm sure it will be well-researched, complete and engaging.  Is there a place we could sign up to get contacted if (when :) ) you start something again?  Having a ready-made audience is no small thing!

Jason

So much to agree with. Indeed, an auspicious portent: ends must come if beginnings are to continue.

This one, though long anticipated, came still with a shock of loss. It's a measure of the life you've brought to the empire's story that it feels like the living Rome will be lost again as the book thins to the last and the tale ends.

There is something selfish here, I admit, the thrill that soon won't come again, that happy anticipation, knowing I have a fresh, untapped half-hour with my patient, funny, industrious and curious friend Mike, who takes the time to tell me of Rome. It's something quite other than a book, because the voice in my head isn't one of mine, it's yours, and you're talking to me, not just reading aloud a text meant for silent study.

You've given me and the world a wonderful connection with an indispensable and fascinating part of humanity's history. I'm certain tens of millions will hear it in time. The straightforward way you told the story, your wry fascination with the puzzles of historical characters and unreliable sources, and your simple, clear, homebaked recording technique fused into a podcast that makes a thousand years of ancient history accessible to anyone who cares to listen. I have already recommended it to dozens of friends, and I'm really gratified to see you getting the recognition you deserve.

Congratulations, thank you, and may you and yours know every happiness.

I've listened to all of these over the years and eventually just came expect that they would continue on until 1453. Wow. Sad to hear you're leaving the show before getting to all the fun with Justinian and later with the Crusades (which I was looking forward to hearing your take on as that's what I studied in college). But alas, all good things must come to an end I guess. Thanks for the many great hours of entertainment.

Mike, while I'm sad to hear it is ending, I certainly understand why that would be necessary. It has been an awesome run, though, hasn't it! I'm now on my fourth trip through the episodes and I'm still amazed by how much enjoyment I have found in your little podcast. I didn't know I liked Roman history until I came upon you in iTunes. Now I struggle to imagine what life will be like when there will be no futher THoR. Thank you for all of the time, effort, and heart that you have poured into this project. I don't know about everyone else, but I can tell you that my life has certainly been enriched by all that you have shared. Congratulations on the pending birth of your son!

Mike,

congratulations so much, it's great to hear that you are having a baby!

Also, as a first time father of a 7 months old girl I can tell you that you are making the right call, things are going to be very different around casa de Thor!

Actually, your podcast has been a very important part of the precious few moments of "me-time" I had during the first months, and with "me-time" I mean having the podcast in my headset while doing house chores and commuting, haha.

Your podcast has been a great thing for me this last year, and I look forward to hearing it several times in the future.

Also, please keep us posted on any future projects!

I therefore have your WHOLE SERIES OF PODCASTS FRESH IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW, and they were fantastic! Thank you so much for this experience and I wish you all the best in fatherhood, which is really, really hard and really, really rewarding!

I would like to join in the congratulations to Mike for the impending arrival of Elagabalus Duncan and for the phenomenal podcast (I first started listening when there were only 13 episodes). As I said in a comment a few weeks ago, Mike deserves to finish this on his terms, and the tag line at the top of the blog saying that THoR would finish at 476 has never wavered, so I have been preparing myself for this for a while now. THoR is an extraordinary achievement and I'm glad for Mike that it is finally almost over for him. The burden to do an episode every week must have been overwhelming, and how he managed to pull it off amazes me.

Having skimmed the other comments, I haven't seen anyone mention this yet, but I bet that the week after it finishes, many (most?) of the THoR listeners will turn around, go back to the first episode, and start the series all over again. I know I will.

P.S. Mrs THoR will come around on Elagabalus if you start pushing for it now.

Thank you so much.  You’ve been the antiquities professor I never had (tech schools are a bit lacking in the humanities) and have awakened an interest in Roman history and ancient history in general that I also never knew I had.

Your skills are such that I’ve had a sense of foreboding for months now and it seems that it was correct for more than just the fate of the Empire.  We all know how it turned out—we knew from the start—but you bring the ancient world to life so well that it’s impossible not to hope just a little that it didn’t actually end and I’d wake up to find my closet full of togas.  Better praise for a historian I do not know how to give.

Congrats to the both of you, of course.  I join the legions in wishing you well, or should that be hailing you. :)

Ok that was petulant and selfish me talking there.  Thanks for your work, I have enjoyed this podcast like no other.  I was hoping you'd hold out until the reign of Justinian, but as the father of two boys I perfectly understand what you are going through.

This is where I try and think of something clever to say, but given the quality and quantity of the comments I have parsed, I don't think there is much left to say.  I just hope that you'll actually get a chance to read the comment, so that I can just say "Thank You."

But seriously... Noooo!!

I have already burned every episode onto CD's which I will likely keep for the rest of my life. I can't help but admit that I almost teared up when I heard you say it was going to end. But then I really teared up when you announced the impending arrival of his son. Congratulations to you and your family. May the greatness of your progeny be Augustan.

Mike, that's wonderful and sad news! I have been a listener since episode 18 and of course went back and started with #1 when I immediately realised how good it was. I've yet to find anything that can rival it for presentation or content.

Your podcast has taken what was a lazy interest in Roman history and inspired me to study every aspect of it. My decision to move to Europe this summer could be attributed directly to the podcast. In less than a month I will be in Italy, looking for an apartment, and planning all my history-related excursions! Thank you so much for the inspiration.

Like a lot of people, as soon as I have heard the last episode I will be loading up #1 and listening to them all again.

I suggest that you create an email list people can sign up to. That way we can be informed when you find yourself with enough time to start a new project (maybe a History of Rome book!) or the opportunity to host new tours. Even if that means waiting until History of Rome Jnr is 16! I'm sure we will all still be interested.

Best of luck to you and your family, and thanks again.

Thanks a lot Mike, I've been following this very faithfully since I first came across it a few years ago. As a Roman history buff I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

I suppose you could call Baby HofR Max - and then have us all puzzled and guessing whether it be Maximus, Maximian, Maximinus or Maxentius.

Sincere best wishes!

Thank you for all your work and time, this is one of the few casts I'm always desperate to get the next episode of! At last I can answer my own question of "where did the Romans go?".

I would like to congratulate you on "baby history of rome". Secondly I would like to thank you for making this pod, I have learned so much about Roman history and life. Sad to see it all end but, as they say, all good things must come to an end. I have one question thou: You mentioned about 50 or 100 episodes ago (not really sure when), that you were planning on making your podcast into a book. It's a book that I am sure that all of us that has listened to your pod would buy, and probably anyone that are interested in history would buy. Has these plans been put on ice as well, or have you discarded the idea all together? Once again, Thank you for making the pod!!!

Congratulations on the news that you will be a father and both my wife and myself wish your wife and yourself all the best for the future. Having one daughter, Andromeda, already and another, Ziva, coming in June, you realise that things change. We have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the History of Rome podcast and will ensure that our daughters listen to it at some point when they are at school.

Good luck for the future and thank you for the 5 years of a legendary podcast.

Many thanks and good luck.

Hey Mike,

This is my first ever comment, usually because someone says what I want to first. I found your podcast back when there were 6 episodes, they were short and the quality wasn't so hot, but you made them special. When you had you long absence I was in withdrawal, and I will be again when it's all over. The podcast just like Rome couldn't go on forever, and they've both been a fantastic ride, thanks in no small part to your presentation. Thanks for all the hard work, and good luck with the baby.

Best Wishes,
Matt G.

P.S. If it's a daughter, There can be no other name but Livia. Agrippina or Urgulanilla are good names, but that's just cruelty.

I am sure you will feel the same way.  I still hope to hear from you again somewhere down the road. But if not, thanks for the ride! It's been a lot of fun and very entertaining!!

As the omen of the legions after the first sack of Rome, 'we may as well stop here.'

It has been great, and as many have, I have been totally ruined for other podcasts; they just can't hold a candle to you.  As a father of three, I have a little advice:
1) Make no promises about what you will accomplish after the birth of your child.  Trust me on this one, whatever you meant to do, you will never even start it, let alone get it done.
2) If it turns out you have twins, under no circumstances should they be named Romulus and Remus.  Can you just imagine what the school playground would be like for them??
3) Your hands will be full.  So will your heart, and your home.  There is no title on this Earth greater than the name "Daddy" from a child's lips.  Enjoy it while you can, they grow up all too fast.

Mike, I've listened to you in car accidents, on the way to the birth of my baby girl, at work, on road trips, on planes, and everywhere in between.  You've chosen an excellent stopping point, although I will miss the podcast deeply.  Listening to the rise and fall of a mighty empire has been an emotional journey of celebration (Caesar Augustus' "golden era") and sadness (the second Sack of Mighty Rome).  Thanks for navigating the journey for us and best of luck to you and Mrs. History of Rome in the future.  Whenever you come back to the "air"waves, let us know - your faithful listeners will still be here.

We've listened to and enjoyed the podcast since you exclaimed, "Brandi, 17 people have downloaded my podcast!"  We've enjoyed all the listeners' comments over the last 5 years.  (Yes, we read them all.) We loved joining you and the other listeners we met and roamed Italy with on THoR Tour last month.

We are looking forward to and will be supportive of the next unique, off-beat, wonderful project you decide to pursue.

(And are *really* looking forward to meeting our third grandson and your first son, Baby XXXXXXXX William Duncan in May.)

Love, Mom and Dad

Dude, Mike, you're child is going to have a badass for a dad.

About 2 years ago I typed Rome into the iTunes search bar to find some extra help for a history test and stumbled onto your little show here. After enjoying the episode and ACING the test I started the series from the very beginning and have loved every moment. I'm on my second run-through. The episodes about Trajan and Aurelian have earned permanent spots on my iPhone. I've even carried on a modest missionary movement and have brought several friends into the HoR flock.

Seriously, Mike, awesome job.I can't wait for Baby the History of Rome to turn 18 so we can get your next show on the American political parties.

Oh, and congratulations.

I could not have imagined the impact this podcast had on me when I nearly shed a tear in the metro while listening to this episode. So I'll add to the pile one more suggestion for a future project: mini-series of a half a dozen episodes on the daily lives of different people throughout history. How did the Byzantines lived, how was daily life in Medieval Europe, etc
Anyway, keep us informed, because I'll certainly check whatever is your next project out.

Thank you very much.

Oh Man, we all knew it woudl happen and that it was fast approaching but what a shock to hear it was actually happening! I was on a flight from London to Lativa when your announcement came through my earphones and more than one passanger turned around with a furious look on their face due to my outburst of curse words.

Fair game though, you have done such an amazing job of this podcast. This was my first foray into listening to podcasts and NOTHING I have listened to thus far is even close to THoR. But as important as it was to have a new THoR every Monday, raising a kid does tend to take priority and I know I barley have time to listen to each episode let alone create one so I can see why this must happen.

Thank you so much for all the pleasure you have given me. One last request though, can we please have another question blow out episode and/or your own ideas on how and why Rome rose so high and then fell so low...

Good luck mate and thanks again,

Bernard, New Zealand

Might I suggest that the lad's name is picked from the following:
Scipio, Marius, Lucius, Julius, Claudius, Hadrian, Aurelius, Thrax (love it!), Domitian, Decius, Diocletian, Constantine, Valentinian or Theodosius.
Try calling them out - it'll help clarify your choices. Personally, I reckon Marius Duncan is brilliant, and would be appropriate considering what a man of the people he was.

Congratulations to you and your wife on becoming parents and thanks for all the great history!

I was wondering, have you considered packaging and selling the podcasts for download (as the History Network does)? I would like to re-listen to the entire series (and I guess I could just do that), but I imagine you could you the funds.

Yes, a great portent for stopping with Romulus Augustulus, but I see no reason for the History of Rome to completely fade from the scene.

I do you'll consider it.

Congratulations on your heir. You have truly created something special here and it will be sorely missed. Your voice brought me into the world of Rome and it's a place I'm sad to be leaving. It will be hard to replace the warm, thoughtful, and well-researched narrative with the stale facts and dates presented by other historical media. You once incredibly made a 16 hour non-stop flight an enjoyable experience and for that and many other moments I am thankful. I really hope one day you do the American history podcast that was mentioned, but I can't complain. You've already done so much. Good luck.

I think this podcast must be published.  You need to be paid to clean up and record a second edition and it should be sold on cd in bookstores and on itunes, audible etc.  Students should have to listen while walking to school. A little discussion, a few tangents to other cultures and history class done. Thank you. WWI and II, or 20th century history needs someone with your writing talent and vocal talent now.

Hi,
In Croatia and old Roman City Cibalia (Vinkovci, this is quite close to imperial Sirmium) an important finding has been found these days.
Around 50 different plates and glasses made of silver and some gold plate and other stuff has been found durign the building reconstruction. It has round 35 kilos of silver and gold.

This is the most valuable tresure found in Croatia.
<a href="http://www.vecernji.hr/data/slika/98/486085.jpg">http://www.vecernji.hr/data/slika/98/486085.jpg</a>

This was placed in the earth and buerried carefully. The date is estimated round 4-5 century so probably these days when manny barbarians plungered the Panonia.

Congratulations on your child, and I hope your life will be prosperous.

I sincerely hope that the History of Rome will still operate after the podcast ends, as I am too young at the moment.

Otherwise, thankyou again and wishing you the best in the future.

Thanks for all the great work.  My daughter, who is in college 500 miles away, got me hooked early on, and it became a ritual for us to call each other every week to discuss the new episode.  I plan to go back to the beginning and listen to them all again as soon as you bring things to a close.  I hope that someday you find the time to edit the podcasts into what would be a truly terrific audiobook.

Hi Mike

I've never commented before and I suppose I have been one of those anonymous listeners for many years. I found the History of Rome waaaaaaay back when it was new -  as a long time devotee to Roman History the moment I saw it in the list I had to have it! And you have done an awesome job of it! I've looked forward to each new podcast each week... Ive been wondering for a while how far you would take it, as we all know there is the argument of just 'when' the 'Roman' empire ended.... (i Tend to be a 1400's fan myself, but i'm nostalgic).
Your podcast has literally crossed the world with me, from Australia to China, to Malaysia, Singapore, England, France, Korea, and back again... Through times good and bad. I actually used the way you worded your history while at university as an example of how ancient history can be made a whole lot more interesting by how you present it!:  (I used your example of Pompey and Crassus.... "Crassus went off to invade Parthia, and Pompey went to the kitchen to make a sandwich"... haha!, love it!)
Really wanted to go on a History of Rome tour and wish I could have, but I have to say, all's well that ends well. You and your podcast will be missed.
Congratulations on becoming a father - May your offspring never be subjected to a Roman Educations! haha! All the best!

It will be a sad day when I get to the final episode (I keep a backlog for drives), but I can always go back and listen again (just so long as Dan Carlin's Hardcore History doesn't come to an end as well!). Perhaps when your child is old enough you'll return to podcasting (I hope so). I'll keep pointing folks to the site and telling them to listen!

Many thanks for all of your work here. It sparked my interest (along with Dan Carlin and Lars Brownworth) in all things ancient again. Good luck to you, Mrs. History of Rome and Future Baby History of Rome!

Just wanted to thank you so much for this podcast.  It is AMAZING.  I don’t remember how I came to download it originally, but I still remember the first time that I heard “Welcome to the History of Rome…” years ago, and it has been wonderful ever since.  This podcast has accompanied me everywhere: commutes, lunch-breaks, and innumerable long drives to visit family up and down the East Coast.  It is just the BEST thing out there.  Before I had no specific interest in Roman history, and now I am a passionate student of the subject.

Finally, congratulations on the news of your son.  I am overjoyed.  I imagine you telling him tales of all the great Roman heroes and villains one day.  When I have children, and thanks to your podcast, I hope to do the same.  Thank you again and good luck.

All loyal listeners: I highly encourage you to make a donation to THoR, if you've not already done so.  It sure would be nice to give Mike a well-deserved send-off as he starts to wind down the podcast.  If even half of us can make a small donation, it will add up to something nice for Mike and the THoR family.

Mike: One last suggestion, if I may ... people are expecting a nice Roman name for your son, and since one era ends with Romulus Augustus, it seems only fitting to grace your son with such an awesome moniker.  OK, OK ... just kidding!  :)

Hi Mike
Thanks so much for all your hard work - it has been most appreciated. I've listened to your podcasts a number of times, as I found having to wait a week for the next release just too hard! Whenever I got to the end I'd go back to the start and listen all over again so that always had the next episode available. THoR has accompanied me through sleepless nights, walking to work, and hiking through remote locations.

Congratulations to you and your wife on your soon-to-arrive child. Much as I will miss THoR (and I will!!!), a shift in priorities is the right move. Good luck and thank you.

[For fellow listeners:  a podcast to help the transition to a post-THoR world is 'A History of the World in 100 Objects' from the BBC and the British Museum. Images to illustrate the objects are online].

Perhaps finish up with a "why were they so great and why did they fall" summing up?!  L anticipate your next podcast endeavour in about 5 years after son of HoR has grown up a bit!

Your top class podcast will be sorely missed. How about signing off with a Q&A podcast, like the 100th/90th episode?
Congratulations on the kid.

To Mike: Adding my my voice to the chorus of thanks and praise, thank you so much for all the work that you've done.  I listen to quite a few podcasts and this has always been the one that I look forward to the most.

To everyone else: I just sent Mike a few bucks via the donation link and I encourage you to do so as well.  I hear that kids are expensive and I certainly owe him a lot for the amount of entertainment and enlightenment that he's given me.

Long time listener - first time writer.
I am very sad to see the podcast ending. I was turned on to it by my sister's husband who is a Phd. in ancient history back when you were still doing the late republic. I have enjoyed the podcast immensely here in Denmark - waking up every monday and turning on my computer to download the latest episode from iTunes. It made the beginning of the week something to look forward to :)

I am sad to see it end and very thankful for your efforts. Congratulations on soon becoming a father and all the best in the future!

I have come late to The History of Rome but I have listened to all 173 podcasts in the last few months.  One that I particularly appreciated was a tour of the empire that gave a rundown of what life was like in the various provinces.  Would it be possible for you to do a similar rundown of the state of the empire at its end?

I taught secondary school for 35 years and always enjoyed teaching the Ancient History part.  I wish you had been there for me when I was still facing "the kids".

Thank you so very much for doing this monumental project and my best wishes to Mrs. History of Rome and the new family members when they arrive.

Hey Mike, thanks so much for your incredible work at THoR. Congrats on growing family and I hope you enjoy your time with your family as the pater familias.

I only started listening to your podcast via a friend about 6 months ago, and caught up to the present about a month ago. It truly has been a great pleasure hearing your work and it has rekindled my love of history that engineering while in college didn't allow time for. There are now about 5 people at work that now listen to the History of Rome because I couldn't help put let other know about your great work.

You have inspired me to want to do a podcast of my own over baseball. If I ever get it going I hope it would be half as good as yours. You set the bar incredibly high.

Thanks again, and congratulations!

Andrew

Thank you for this contribution!  I don't know what all the fuss is, I have listened to most of the episodes more than once and look forward to listening to the history of Rome for years to come!!!  One special request though, back in the Antonine years, you did an episode about each province.  Could you do the same podcast, only recapping how and when each province was lost to the west?  I ask this, because I am having a hard time understanding just how little territory these last emperors control.  Congrats on the baby, I have a one year old and your making the right call.  But please, find time to capitalize on your achievements with a book or something else we can buy in the coming years.

Congratulations on the little historian!  My only piece of parenting advice is to find yourself a good podcast to listen to :-)  You've been my companion while holding our third child (our first daughter) who is really, really anti-sleep.  She just turned one and has finally decided that maybe sleep is good after all, but a good 30 minutes of THoR makes 30 minutes of baby rocking (or baby nursing, but you're off the hook on that!) go by much quicker.

Best wishes as you end one season of your life and enter another.  Parenthood is exhausting, but the most wonderful thing you'll ever do (though any given day may be significantly less than wonderful).

Mike, thank you so much for a truly exemplary podcast.  I've been listening to you every week for almost three years now, and while I was somewhat saddened to hear that it will be ending I am far happier for you and your wife and your new child!  Listening to your voice narrate the history of Rome has been one of the most consistently pleasant moments in this era of my life, and I suppose that it is only fitting that it ends as I, like you, enter a new phase.  We all wish you nothing but the best.

You also mentioned a book, so we’ll keep a hopeful watch. Meanwhile, congratulations on soon becoming a Dad! No matter how much you enjoyed your work on THoR, it will pale in comparison to fatherhood. As busy as you will be, you will eventually find your pace, and we will look forward to your next effort when you do.

What book(s) did you read on Scipio Africanus? The phrase " Mix of Jim Morrison, Alexander the Great and Jesus" really caught me ear.

Congratulations on soon being "Mr & Father  The History of Rome"

Mike,

I am very sad to hear you will quit the podcast. It feels like the parting of a friend.

I very much appreciate your show and want to thank you for all those hours of fantastic learning and entertainment.

It's all for a good reason; your new born will deserve all the love and attention it can get. I hope you and mrs. The History of Rome will find a lot of joy and fullfillment in the family expansion.

I keep hoping you will make a new show, or point out shows worth following. A nice idea would be to end it with another 'question and answers' session as you did with the 100th episode. Or make the book you were once talking about. Either way, it has been a blast, thanks for the good times and for lighting up my fire for Rome.

Love and all the best,

Sebastiaan

Mike,

I started listening to your podcast when my youngest daughter was just born, and now, she's five. I've always listened to it on many subway stations in Hong Kong, as well as being a constant weekly companion while driving through Manila. We all knew it was bound to end one day, but it has been a blast, being a HOR buff for as long as I can remember, and your show has made such names such as Scipio Africanus, Gaius Marius, Stilicho and others seem all to familiar.

Good luck on your next adventure in life. We'll be fine.

And if your life happens to have some free time in a few years, and you decide to do the history of Byzantium (or most any subject) let us know, I'll listen.  Thanks again.

I've been a fan for years; I usually listen while walking my dogs, with the result that there are some locations in my neighborhood that I now indelibly associate with, say, Nerva, or Diocletian, or the Punic Wars. Sorry as I am to see the podcast coming to an end, I'm looking forward to starting the whole thing over from the beginning. And once I'm through with that, doing it a third time. Meantime, though -- savoring these last few weeks.

Mike, your podcast has been an absolute joy, and has got my whole family hooked.  I shall be so sorry to see it end, but you've made the right decision, and with fatherhood looming, life will never be the same again!  With young children myself (3 boys, so any time you want advice in son handling, just shout) the history of Rome tours were just not feasible for us but something we'd looked forward to indulging in once the boys were a bit older. I hope you'll find a way to continue with  them. And whether your future holds another podcast series or not, what you have achieved with Rome will leave you with friends and admirers worldwide.

I just wanted to genuinely say thank you for all the time effort and love you put into the podcast over the years. Like other posters I knew it would have to come to an end someday but I secretly hoped you would change mind and go right on up to the fall of Constantinople!  I'm not the worlds most emotional guy, but lying there in bed listening to you tell us all the end was nigh, i was quite unexpectedly overcome with sadness. One big regret is that due to the arrival of my newborn son and other mainly financial issues I never got to go on one of the THoR tours. I recall you mentioned that you plan to use your labours as the preliminary work for a book. Please keep us informed as I intend to purchase a copy. Congratulations and best of luck to you and Mrs THoR, I am sure you baby will bring you immense joy.

We have never met, but for the past 5 years or so I have found a friend with an always insightful podcast waiting for me. You have been with me during jogs, road trips or just during relaxing afternoons in the hammock. I think all of us knew this day was coming sooner or later, hence the complete lack of Roman domination in our present day, but were oddly surprised when we heard the announcement. So let me add my post to the heap of thank-you's already in place. Thank you for all of the time, dedication to making this wonderful podcast. Thank you for knowing when to end, as there are fewer things sadder than staying at the party too long.

Good luck with your new chapter in your family. Enjoy your son! We will all miss you, but we will find comfort knowing your absence is from a worthy cause! Please let us know if you decide to write a book, I'm sure there are a couple of us that would buy a book or two. Good-bye and Thank you!

Really sad to see the podcast end.  Especially sad to see you're ending it on a somber note with Romulus Agustulus.  I was hoping you would make up to the Byzantine Empire, being of the camp that the Empire ended with Constantine XI.  Good luck with the kid, I had my first last November and I know how much work it takes in the beginning.  For all the fans I'd recommend checking out Lars Brownworth's podcast "12 Byzantine Rulers".  Not as comprehensive as the "History of Rome" but he's a great story teller.  Thanks again Mike.

Dear Mike,
I have not posted anything before but have been an avid fan for the past two years and have listened to every episode at least once - usually while walking my dog. Your announcement was surprisingly emotional. This podcast has been something special and I've been hooked by it. You are an outstanding teacher. You have clearly worked so hard to make your podcasts clear, interesting and engaging - these things don't just happen. I also became a father to a little boy 6 months ago and it is hard work so I totally appreciate that you need to knock this project on the head. Your son will no doubt be very proud of what you've done with this when he comes to listen to it one day. I sincerely hope that there will be other work in the future for us to enjoy. All the best and if you're ever in the neighbourhood, it'd be a delight to make your aquaintance.
So thanks a lot. All the best.

I can't tell you how sad I am to hear the show will soon be ending. I guess we knew it had to come. I have been listening since the beginning and remember when you got the new microphone. The only reason I loook forward to Monday mornings is because I get to listen to the show.
     Congrats on the baby! I wonder if or what Roman name the baby will have? I liked the idea of having a last episode as something of a question and answer, like the 100th episode. I really wish I could afford to go on one of the History of Rome Tours but financial reasons barred me from doing so. Good luck in parenthood and life! Thank you so much for the show!

Mike,

I think you've picked a pretty reasonable end-point for the podcast. And it sounds like you're going to be busy. Congratulations to you and the Mrs.

One question and a few requests:

Q: Will you continue doing the History of Rome Tours?

R: I would hate to have the series end with the disappointing last emperors of the west.

R: It would be great to get a series wrap-up episode as a whole, similar to the Q&A one you did earlier.

R: It would be awesome to get "what happened next" episodes, preferably one for each of the Western and Eastern empires. A sketch of the history of the Byzantines from the fall of the West to, say, the conquest of Constantinople would be neat. For the West... well, the stories of the successor states, and maybe even the "emperors" of the Holy Roman Empire, are worth some note.

Anyway, I hope you take some time to look back at the great work you've done, analyze, and summarize. It's a momentous achievement and I think you have a lot to be proud of. Go out with a bang, not a whimper (or an exile or what have you).

I discovered THoR after my first visit to Rome last summer, and it has kept that trip alive in my head with more detail than I ever expected to know about Roman history.  When you have more time on your hands, I urge you to create a podcast that takes another slice across Roman history along the lines of your A Day in the Life, Provincial Matters, and Hundredth Episodes.  While there is a lot of intrigue at the top, I yearn for more of what life was like for the average Roman, along with exploring the economics, arts, sports, etc. of the Empire.  Another idea would to focus on Rome the city from birth through it's decline and then recovery in the 2nd millenium.  Whatever you end up doing, I'm sure it will be great.  Oh, and Augustus would be a great middle name.

Hi Mike,

I love the podcast, and have just caught up after discovering it in a roundabout way - I was listening to the British History podcast which picks up after the Romans abandoned Britain, and wanted to know more about the history of Roman Britain, so...there you go.

But my comment is actually only tangentially related to THOR. I remember that not long ago you recommended Monopoly by Mike Daisey as an Audible item to look at. I don't know if you listen to This American Life on NPR, but they featured an excerpt of Daisey's monologue on Apple manufacturing in China not very long ago. Well, in the podcast episode of This American Life that came out today (which means the episode would have been broadcast over the weekend in most markets) Ira Glass and his team have discovered that many parts of the story about Daisey's alleged trip to China were made up. He apparently lied about many of the details in his monologue, and then lied to the This American Life producers to cover up his lies during their fact-checking process. Many of the things he said are indeed true, but many of the more poignant, personal details of his trip were completely fabricated.

The TAL producers eventually tracked down Daisey's interpreter Kathy, and she was able to give them the real story- backed up by emails. I suspect you might be interested to hear that episode of This American Life, since you mentioned that Daisey is an inspiration of yours. The episode is entitled "Retraction"

I was unfamiliar with Daisey until the TAL episode, so perhaps he always admits to embellishment during his "regular" gigs.

But sadly, when he went on This American Life he agreed to be held to journalistic standards of truth and not report on anything that had not happened.

I haven't even finished listening to the This American life episode! Supposedly Daisey himself will come on and explain himself, so it should be very interesting. As soon as heard Ira's introduction I went straight to the computer because I felt like I had to let you know!

Many thanks from a grateful listener,
Kacey A.

Hi Mike,

I heard about your podcast when listening to the History of England Podcast by David Crowther (<a href="http://historyofengland.typepad.com/),">http://historyofengland.typepad.com/),</a> maybe the same one that Kacey mentions.

I started listening to your podcast on 3rd January. Every time that you gave your introduction to the next podcast, it was already available in iTunes. Now I have caught up with you I have to wait for your next installment.

Thanks so much for this podcast and all of the work that you obviously put in to it.

cheers,

Steve

Hi Walter (and Steve),

So I've discovered two good podcasts for British/English history on iTunes, and I actually confused the two in my first comment...sorry about that!

The one I MEANT to mention, that picks up after the Romans abandoned Britain, is indeed (as Steve said above) "The History of England Podcast" by David Crowther. It is on iTunes for sure, and the web site is <a href="http://historyofengland.typepad.com/blog/archives.html">http://historyofengland.typepad.com/blog/archives.html</a>

The other one, the one I actually named, is called "The British History Podcast" by Jamie Jeffers. It can also be found on iTunes. <a href="http://thebritishhistorypodcast.com/">http://thebritishhistorypodcast.com/</a>

The major differences between the two are style and starting points.

Material:

BRITISH (Jamie Jeffers): Starts with prehistory and quickly moves along through the original inhabitants, and DOES cover the Roman occupation, in quite a bit of detail.

ENGLAND (David Crowther): Starts with the arrival of the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons, and the Britains' appeal to Aetius for help, which is ignored. He specifically calls it the ENGLISH history podcast because he said he will not cover the individual political histories of Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, except when they overlap with (or, more accurately, clash with) that of England.

Style:

BRITISH: Jamie has an American accent, although he is a British citizen. He sounds like a younger person, perhaps in his late 20's or early 30's. He has a fairly informal, conversational style, and will interject comments like: "I mean really, what was this guy thinking?"

ENGLISH: David Crowther has an English accent (actually, he sounds Welsh to my non-expert ears). He sounds older than Jamie, but not at all "old." I would guess he is in his early 40's, perhaps. Crowther also uses an informal style, but it is less conversational and more dryly humorous. For instance "It's at this point that, if you listen carefully, you can begin to hear the embarrassed shuffling of Baronial feet."


Personally, I prefer David Crowther's delivery. I only wish that he had covered the Roman occupation! But I subscribe to both and find them both very enjoyable. Although I listened to ENGLAND and THOR together to understand the timeline of both areas at once, after ENGLAND moved on I've pretty much stuck with BRITISH. I'm biased in favor of possibly-Welsh accents, I suppose!

P.S. The Daisey monologue in question was called "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs." After listening to the entire TAL episode, I am very disappointed in Daisey. His delivery may still be excellent, but his credibility is completely shot. It's impossible to believe a word he says now, which is very, very sad.

Hey Mike,

Am currently making my way through the back episodes (up to 127) but thought I'd post here just so people would see it.

Throughout the whole period after Augustus/Octavian the Romans were threatened almost constantly by Germanic tribes across the Danube and Rhine. Why didn't one of the stronger emperors like Trajan or Augustus himself just annex the whole of modern day Germany and Austria i.e. eliminate these overtly aggressive tribes? It seems foolish to have just left them there on the doorstep of the Roman empire.

Love the podcast btw.

@ Harry

I think i might be able to answer this for you. Alot of Roman Emperors wanted to stay at the defensable borders Agustus had set up. By that i mean behind the Rhine and Danube rivers. If they had gone past those rivers, the frontier line would be a lot larger and harder to defend.

My 2 cents anyway.

Augustus wanted to have the frontier along the elbe because the Danube - Elbe frontier was shorter than the Rhine- Danube frontier.

Candidly, I think the Romans could have managed the Elbe had the moved north from the Danube instead of advancing from the west. The Germans would have awakened one day to find themselves in Roman territory and that would have been that.

However, the Romans had more contact with Germany both before and after the famous defeat than was commonly thought. Archaeology is showing more Roman military presence in Germany further east than previously thought.

I think that transportation and a very thin money economy were limiting factors. The Romans were not big on small change and the military was paid in large denominations which limited the usefulness of the money, so barter was more important.

Thankyou to Kacey A, I'll check into the Jamie Jeffers podcast. I also enjoy David Crowther's work.
I can recommend
<a href="http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/home">http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/home</a>
for a glimse into the origins of western philosophy and as a story in itself, to complement Roman History from the point of concepts and understanding of learned people at the time of the Romans and before them. (If there was a podcast of the history of history, I might be interested in that too!)
@_@
Peter Adamson's work on the history of philosophy (without any gaps) is easy to listen to, his speech is precise and measured and what I always imagined as concepts way above my understanding, are presented in a way I can cope with, with history being the main theme.
I have learnt so much from these podcasts and in particular this forum, from people I may never meet, thankyou everyone

I think the reason Chalons is confusing to follow is because it actually was a confusing battle. I imagine that having such large forces under so many commanders from different peoples really made the ancient modes of communication inadequate. I am sure they didn't have a computerized bird-eye view simulation thingy in a room where they can sip soda and direct each detachment in real time the way those BBC "experts" do. Also, looking at the plan I get the feeling that Theodoric's plan was all about glory possibly including death in battle from the start. He's getting old, he has a son and he is ready. I feel like from the beginning he is gunning straight for the enemy camp.

First of all, welcome back. Secondly, I must say that you are to good. I'm only twelve years old, and even before I began to listen to your podcast, my favorite history was Rome. But thanks to you, I really begin to know the true history of this grand empire. I would really like to suggest 381A.D. Sadly I do not know who it is by, or if it is an audiobook, but if you find it, it would be a good read. And also, when Attila storms to the gates of Italy then Rome, please do not forget Pope Leo1, and how he lead Attila into his tent, stayed there from almost night to day, and then when the pope left the tent, Attila left, and didn't touh the empire again. If I have my facts extremely wrong, I apologize and implore you to tell me please. And I can't wait for the next podcast. (:

Hi Mike,
Been listening to this ever since I was planning for last summer's trip to Italy and am nearly caught up. Thank you for this fantastic podcast. My husband is happy that I can talk Roman history with him (a big hobby of his) and during some long drives over the holidays I introduced him to the podcast. He was skeptical at first but then really enjoyed it and appreciated the research you put into the show.

I particularly appreciate the way that you continually reference past and future events, helping us see relationships over time, across spaces, and between political, economic, geographical (etc.) influences.

Even joined Audible and am trying to decide between Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plutarch for my next listen. :)

All the best and THANK YOU.

Mike, thanks so much for putting this podcast together.

I think it was because my most memorable teacher was my Jr. High Latin teacher that I have always had an interest in Classics - history, mythology, archaeology... (Mr Zelmanowitz beating out the conjugations and declensions with his pointer was truly inspirational.)

Your show has reignited that interest into a bit of an obsession (all be it a healthy one).

BTW - the bibliography is is really helpful.

Mike, I'm a huge fan, and though I haven't been able to go on either of the tours (busy having/raising babies), I have been there in spirit.

I just saw a tweet from OpenCulture about an international effort to model ancient Rome around 320 AD. It is incredible. Watch the videos, everyone, if you get a chance.

Oh, I don't visit to blog very often, so maybe this came up already in discussions. But I saw it and had to tell someone. So here you go!

A pack of drunken Huns rampaging their way across the Empire.  All the way to the Theodosian Walls.

Have fun.

Hi to Mike and all other THORers.
I have a quick question for any 'geeks' out there who may be able to help me.  I am currently considering moving away from the iphone as their Tarrifs here in the UK are about double that of a comparible android.  I currently use icatcher for my podcasts on the iphone which is not available on android.  I tried out google listen on a friends phone which seems ok but I cant seem to find THOR on it.  It sounds stupid but this has a serioue effect on my decision making.  Does anyone know a good podcast client that can be used on android THOR appears on.

P.S.  Mike - this is an excellent podcast thank you for making it.

Mike,
Benn listening for about 6 months and have been meaning to reach out.  I love the podcast.  My wife and friends roll their eyes when I discuss it much less suggest we listen "together, " but I am learning so much.  As a pastor, I have also drawn many great illustrations from your work.  Thank you for making my weekly sermons more interesting and historically informed.  In particular, your Christmas episode about Sol Invictus was super-helpful.  I must be a groupie now because whenever I listen, I say those opening words along with you, "Hello, and welcome to the history of Rome."  Don't change a thing bro...you are really onto something here.

Peace,
Wade

Hey Mike,

I'm a huge fan of the podcast! It's what got me interested in ancient history, and Roman history in general. It has been a few years since I first listened, and over time the podcasts have become better and better. I know that we are in the midst of the craziness of the 5th century, but if you ever come to a point where it seems appropriate, I think it would be really interesting to discuss immigration and how the amazing multi-ethnic empire functioned and dealt with various peoples. It seems about the right time to discuss it so we can get a handle on why various peoples are where. Thanks again for the great podcast and I look forward to listening to this episode!

I enjoy THOR.  The best sequence of pod casts was the late republic as it was new history to me without the confusion of multiple similarly named players that infest the time line from the crisis onwards.  I didn't know how little I knew but I've enjoyed learning.

I discovered this podcast in early 2009.

I was so intrigued with the way Mike Duncan brings the subject to life that I feverishly listened to all of the preceding episodes to catch up to where he was at the time.  I've never missed an episode since then and download them to my Zune for listening in the car.

Now that we are within decades of the end of the western empire maybe we can persuade Mr. Duncan to continue the podcast into the Byzantine era of the empire or maybe the Holy Roman Empire;  either way this would give him almost another thousand years of history to bring to life.

Dear Mike and HOR community,


I discovered The HOR after visiting Rome for Christmas in 2011.  Upon returning to the states, on a whim, i did a search for history of Rome on the app store. That was 1 month and 25 days ago.  Since then I have been hooked and just this morning I finally caught up with the latest podcast.

45 days to listen to 170+ podcasts, I wonder if that is some kind of record:-)

I had to go to Istanbul in January for work so I was motivated to get to that part of the (his)story. That may explain the speed at which I consumed the material.  (yes I do have a full time job:-)  While in Istanbul I made sure to visit the Theodocian Walls. You should have seen the look on my client's face when that, of all things in Istanbul, was the first and most important thing I wanted to see on my day off. (What, no Haga Sophia?)

Absorbed by the HOR I have not taken you up on too many of your audible recommendations except for Monopoly by Mike Daisey.  You gave it such a glowing recommendation I had to listen.  It was good, and while I like Daisey, I like HOR much much better....

Mike- you make many mentions of the lifecycle of the Roman Empire in the recordings.  I am unsure if you are familiar with the book "Managing Corporate Lifecycles" but the history of the roman republic fits the lifecycle path described in this book perfectly. I would be happy to send you a copy if you send me an address.  I plan on writing a document paralleling the Roman republics' lifecycle and the USA lifecycle using the corporate lifecycle model for my internal organization.  (But you have already done all the work for me, plain to see for anyone who has read the book and listened to your podcast)

I want to thank you - Mike - for providing this podcast, which I am sure will be a classic.

I also want to thank the HOR community for their interest.  I have been talking up the HOR to everyone I know and no one has heard of it.  So thank you HOR community, whom ever you are, for tuning in, creating a market and encouraging Mike to continue with this project.  Without you I would be the only dork in town with nothing to listen to.

Finally, my question.  I was told that Budda of Budda-pest,  the two cities now one that make up the capital of Hungary, was named after the brother of Atilla.  In episode 170 you use a different name for the brother of Atilla.... Can you clarify if the story I heard about Budda is correct?

With tremendous respect...

Shoham

Desperately catching up here - I get to listen to about one-and-a-half episodes a day on my commute to and from work, and I'm loving it.

However, I'm only at episode 104, so am frantically trying to catch up *before* you get to Romulus Augustulus :D

Mike,

I really like the podcast.  Lately, however, I think it is getting a bit bogged down by dynastic succession stuff.  Can you do an episode detailed the economic collapse of the empire, describing how far things had fallen?  Were towns losing their aqueducts and grain doles?

Also, can you describe the strangeness of the Huns?  I understand that they were very wierd people to the Romans, even more so than the Celts and Goths.  For example, they rode horses so much that they were chronically stunted and bow-legged.  They had tattoos and flesh mutilations and would keep body parts of enemies as trophies.  I know this sounds ethnocentric, but I understand that the Huns, more so than these other barbarians, really seemed like the spawn of Satan to the Romans and not just for their military success.

So, I found this podcast three weeks ago, and have now listened to every episode.  I just want to say, thank you.  This is awesome, and I hope that you continue with these podcasts after the fall of Rome, in whatever fashion you want.  If not, the last three weeks of my life were pretty awesome (my non-loving of history wife would disagree).

@Benn I use Android. All you need to do is go to Mike's page here, click on the episode then choose download. Each episode will be downloaded with your music in its own file, The History of Rome. You can also just listen directly but while listening you won't be able to use other apps. When listening, if a call comes in, the story pauses. After the call ends the story comes right back.
Good luck.

You don't have to go to Rome to see it, as there is a full size cast, in two sections, in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Hi All:

I'm about 65% of the way through making an A1 (840x600 mm) poster timeline of the Roman Republic as a companion to my chart of the Roman emperors, both inspired by Mike's podcasts. To wit:

<a href="http://www.archsoc.com/charts/history/Republic_of_Rome.pdf">http://www.archsoc.com/charts/history/Republic_of_Rome.pdf</a>

I thought I'd make it available now for comments before I get too far gone. What information is missing? Is the layout confusing? There are many things I already want to improve (such as the maps), and as you will see in the late republic I'm having a tough time fitting in all the info I want, but there you go.

Any comments welcomed.

Garry

My name is Wale and I’m listening from Lagos, Nigeria and have done since late 2007!

I can’t even describe how excellent the podcast is or the impact it’s had on me personally over the last few years so let’s just say profound!

It seems to me though that we are rapidly approaching the final episode.   If I’m not mistaken the exile of Romulus Augustus was in the 470s AD and were already in the 440s as of the last episode.   Does this mean there are only 3/4 episodes left??  What next???????!!!!

Mike, you're a fascinating lecturer, and I imagine that your attention is in a great deal of demand these days, but I hope that you will consider extending the scope of this podcast, but if not, I wish you the best in all your future endeavors.

I'm dreading the end of the podcast as much as everyone else (I've been listening since around episode 13, long enough to remember the 5-month break in the early 30s), but I also think we should 'let' Mike finish it on his own terms without making him feel like he didn't give us enough. I can imagine that after nearly five (FIVE!) years of doing The History of Rome, he is more than ready to move on to something else.

I think the final decades of the narrative, plus some survey-type episodes, a look back through the centuries, a brief look forward to the lasting impact of Rome, and a final question blow-out might get him to 200 episodes which would be a phenomenal achievement. We should let him enjoy that - at least for a few weeks, and then we can start demanding The History of Baseball...

You said it all Nick. As sad as it is for me to see this coming to its natural conclusion, It's up to Mike. He has taken the weight of this show on his own shoulders and for that me and thousand others, now and still to come, owe a debt of gratitude hardly anyone of us can possibly hope to express in this blog. He is the captain, the leader, the orchestra director. He calls the shots and everybody will abide to hes terms. After five years of history of Rome, he deserves any and all consideration on our part, not to mention our full support. No matter what. Thanks a lot man.

Lots of good requests.  Mine is a trip through the development of England starting with the Norman invasion and culminating with the triumph of Elizabeth over the Spanish armada.  Or maybe you could just explain the ever perplexing (to me) war of the roses.  Anyway I have enjoyed this podcast tremendously and will miss it.

I found this podcast about a month ago. Listened episodes 1 to 168 in about three weeks. Almost non-stop. My wife almost kicked me out of the bed because of that "damn earphones on your head all the time".

I tried a lot of other podcasts but none was really satisfying except maybe The History of Philosophy (without any gaps), by Peter Adamson.

Besides the content being great and well written, there's a few other qualities it's difficult to find around:

1) the pace of the story is easy to follow. I don't get drowned in names and dates. There's enough for each episode to have substance, but not too much.

2) the fluidity and clarity of the reading. There's a couple of famous history podcasts that I just can't follow because the guys read too fast, without adequate punctuation, and not clearly enough for  me. As the author himself said: he writes things to be read, and to be read by himself. He really succeeds in this.

The only other history podcast in which I found those qualities is the one I mentioned above.

So, Mike, if you decide to keep podcasting, change the topic at will, and I'll keep listening. Even if you decide to talk about latvian cuisine, raelian creation myths or gardening techniques.

Hey Mike. Love your podcast. Any chance you can visit the army of the 5th century in one of your episodes? In earlier episodes, you explain how the Roman army fights, but how has that changed in the 5th century? Is their armor and weapons different from the army of Augustus? Have tactics changed? Why does it seem that the Roman army is just....inferior to the barbarians? Is an Augustan era soldier better trained and equipped than his 5th century counterpart? Just something to think about.

I thought it might end when Constantine moved the capitol to the East or with the sack of Rome, but the last Western Emperor seems a good place to close the story.
When it ends I plan go back and listen again from ep.1.
Byzantium I know very little about, so a podcast about that would be of interest to me. I read Procopius' Secret history last year as a taster.

Curious...In honor of Super Bowl Sunday, I would think that THOR would do a special on the most popular sports of the Roman Empire. Fingers crossed but if THOR goes into the reign of Justinian, the topic of chariot racing will be interesting.

Not that I'm complaining though, another great episode Mike.

Great podcast. Finally cought up with it, started two months ago. Great show!

Am I correct that the 'magister militium' is Master of the Foot?
As in previous episodes the Master of the Horse was mentioned as such, in English, and not Magister Equus (or whatever it would be in Latin).
It was slightly confusing for me and thought maybe the Roman army was again heavily reorganised somewhere along the line and I missed it.

I want to thank you for providing this and compliment you on the conciseness, clarity, and the vibrancy in which you recreate the rise and fall in all its aspects. This must take a lot of research and editing effort; the 4 years of work thus far are much appreciated.

Against all better knowledge, I hope it doesn't all end once we get to 476.

Ditto on the great episode.  I finally caught up a few episodes back, and have to say I got spoiled being able to listen nonstop for a while there.  Now having to wait weekly is killing me!  All the worse because it may be coming to an end soon.  I hope you decide to continue with the East until the fall of Constantinople, but I can understand if you want to take a break and not continue for another 1000 years!  I look forward to hopefully joining you on the History of Rome Tour in the near future  (too bad you don't go to Istanbul/Constantinople anymore...).

Hey mike

Back in episodes just before 100, you did a few episodes on regular romans, religion, etc. And then a q&a for episode 100.  Do you think of doing something similar soon, maybe explain how life would change after 476 for regular folks?  Also, i'd love to get answers to questions such as:
Which 5 roman moments are really overrated?
Why is it that we westerners have discounted the eastern empire as continuity of the roman empire?  After all we still teach 476 as THE fall date.

Anyway been listening for years, and were it not for a baby, would have been in the tour couple of weeks from now!  Have fun!

Hi Mike,
I know Aetius is a great general and all, but i stumbled upon the career of the general Anatolius in the East, who dealt in a quite uncharacteristic friendly manner with both Sassanids and Attila, with success, and I hope we'll be lucky to hear what you find about him :)
Keep it up !

Another splendid podcast, Mike!  I saw an old TV movie a while back in which Powers Boothe played Flavius Aetius.  Your podcast gave me a better picture of who Flavius Aetius was.  I also hope to read more about him (and Attilia) soon.

I would love to attend one of your Roman history tours.  I went to Constantinople in 2009 and Rome in 2010, and want to go back.  I am getting married in April and cannot this year so hopefully your will do another tour in 2013.

I hope that you will stay in the podcasting business after you finish up THoR with the exile of Romulus Augustulus. You have a good voice, a wry sense of humor, and excellent research skills, which are necessary for the history podcasting business.  Also, let us know if you are writing a book on Roman history as part of THoR.  I would be interested in reading it.

Enjoy Austin!  It is a fabulous city!

I just got to this episode. I was pretty surprised to hear you heaping praise upon Mike Daisey just a month before the world was heaping scorn upon him. I think the orgy of shame was a bit hyperbolic since he didn't make any facts up, he just made up his personal relation to them. To put it into perspective, it would be a miracle if an episode of THOR had access to good enough information to be as factual as Daisey's act of non-journalism. Heck, most actual journalists are less concerned with facts than he was.

Thus ends a comment no one will read about a subject no one cares about anymore. My favorite kind of comment!

Great show as always. I too look forward to the next episodes. Aetius is a very interesting character in history. He is the Roman tradition mixed with the pragmatic reality of a splintered empire. The fact that he was able to wield power effectively for over 3 decades in the chaotic 5th century says a lot about him. The last of the Romans is a fitting title for him indeed...

A very good intro to Aetius! I am looking forward to hearing more about him as he is the Last of the Romans. I may have a correction as I thought that Aetius was pronounced as Aye Shus and not A TEE US. Forgive my attempt to sound out  the name. I could be wrong, but I thought I remembered hearing it pronounced that way in an undergrad class. Please keep up the fantastic work Mike!

I have seen Aetius written Aëtius, which would give Ay-e-tee-us.

I'm a British English speaker, so that may have a bearing on it ;-)

Thanks for all the hard work you do Mike.  I've been following along since nearly the beginning.

I've "read" several of the recommendations you have made, and I'm looking for something a bit different now.  Can anyone suggest a good book on Greek history?  From Audible of course.  I know virtually nothing of it, so even a general history would be fine.

You cite that Valentine the III was not formally declared a Ceasar or Augustus which left the door open for a usurper. Was Yowanas (the Notary which I am sure I am misspelling) a Ceasar or some other official level that allowed this to be justified any better than Valentine?

Five years ago I visited Ravenna and was much impressed by the fabulous mosaics. Among the buildings housing these was the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.The mosaics in this building were absolutely stunning, but the name Galla Placidia meant nothing to me at the time. Thank you Mike for bringing her to life. I am beginning to see why she deserved such a memorial.
Google Images of Galla Placidia show most of the mosaics as well as a portrait of GP herself and her 2 children. She was a fine looking woman.

"In 423, Honorius will finally do something worthwhile, and die."

YES. Thank you for saying this.  Honorius, I am so done with you and your shenanigans.  Or total lack of shenanigans, rather.  Hey, maybe he's actually been dead this whole time, and the court's just been covering it up!  Because that would explain a lot.

Excellent episode as usual, thanks Mike! :)

For those interested in Galla Placidia, there's a biography of her "Galla Placidia: The Last Roman Empress" by Hagith Sivan.

I TOTALLY agree with this week's book recommendation.  "At Home" is FANTASTIC and really eye-opening about everyday down-home history.  It's amazing how many modern conveniences we take for granted.  The book covers some that you might not have thought of.  That book was the first Bill Bryson I read.  I've since gone on to read everything he's written and I love his style.  Like this podcast, his books mix a lot of history with a touch of humor.  Can't recommend it more.

As to this week's THOR episode... well... I'm just now sitting down to listen.

Five years ago I visited Ravenna and was much impressed by the fabulous mosaics. Among the buildings housing these was the mausoleum of Galla Placidia.The mosaics in this building were absolutely stunning, but the name Galla Placidia meant nothing to me at the time. Thank you Mike for bringing her to life. I am beginning to see why she deserved such a memorial.
Google Images of Galla Placidia show most of the mosaics as well as a portrait of GP herself and her 2 children. She was a fine looking woman.

It is just ridiculous how the Gothic sack of Rome is considered this big moment but shortly afterwards the Goths are allying with the Romans, then getting outmanuevered and surrendering to them.  The average man in the street had to be bewildered at who was a friend and who was an enemy and who was winning and who was losing at any one time.

And, I RARELY use that word, but Michael (or Mike?) is an excellent communicator. I am trying to get everyone I know on board. My son, also a US Marine, I am poking with stick. SO much translates to modern era.

Bonus: No pompous wind bag with a speech impediment. (British old fart), etc.

I actually donated money. Yes, surprised myself. I am at ep 81. Trajan. Took a while because I listen repeatedly esp during Augusta's period. Most interesting in my opinion.

Mike, keep it up. And, when you get move through this to other sets of work, announce them, I will follow and bring the "Crass, vulgar, and an unrepentant hedonist …" with me.

How dare the people at the Onion suggest Mike's jokes sometimes fall flat?!? Mike's ironic detachment is one of the essential elements of the podcast's greatness; and besides, I can't recall Mike telling a single "joke" in the entire History of Rome. Very cool that the Onion gives a mention, but the appropriate stance is one of mute admiration, not ill-informed quibbling. This is something up with which I will not put.

settle a debate amongst co workers/listeners
one side says that the fall of rome was the end of everything roman brought on dark ages ect ect

another side says that at the time Rome was Rome in name only that the government was even in rome when it fell it was in Ravena and Constantinople and there was really nothing there to conquer making the fall of rome like the united states losing control of nyc a major blow.
 but the rest of the country was still standing so it was all symbolic and one city in thousands across the county was just ONE city

@ Robert.
Firstly, dark ages is a misnomer. It's the Middle Ages or Medieval. :P

Rome had ceased to be of any real political significance and lost a large percentage of its population well before the continued sieges and eventual sack by Alaric and his Goths. So yes, it was symbolic as Milan and then Ravenna became the seats of power in the western empire. But Rome the city was not conquered by the Goths, it was only sacked.

@Soup

From scattered comments I gather that medievalists take nearly as much umbrage with "middle ages" and "medieval"—the idea being that such terms suggest that the era's greatest achievement was that it happened to trip and fall between two other things more worthy of mention.

As to whether the sacking was the end of Rome or only symbolic, I think Mike's made it pretty clear how merely symbolic it was. But the question of when "Rome" really ended surely depends on as many interpretive assumptions as does the counting of Roman emperors. I tend to think the marble-clad classical Rome they taught us about in school was basically Julio-Claudian, with everything afterwards being far too involved and nowhere near prurient enough to merit serious scholarly interest.

On the other hand Rome the bearer of more or less unquestioned imperium would have to go up to at least Commodus. The brevity of Pertinax's reign and the shameful auctioning to Didius Julianus seems to me just as much a symbolic endpoint as Alaric's sacking.

And then again, up until the death of Alexander Severus one could be a raving lunatic or a near–Bertie Wooster level nincompoop and still spend a lifetime mismanaging the empire without any terribly serious consequences.

My gut feeling is that Commodus was the last classical Roman emperor. Aurelian was just shoring up the ruins and Diocletian was already half Byzantine.

It kind of boggles the mind that Alaric and Brennus' sacks of Rome were as distant as I am now from the 4th Crusade.  You know we can point out all the mistakes the Romans made and the problems they had in their last century but it is incredible the constant pressure they were under from their enemies ever since...about the reign of Marcus Aurelius.  And they just kept on coming.  But the Western Roman Empire has one last period where it sort of looks like they might make it through after all coming up here it appears.  But look how bad things look and the Huns have not even shown up yet.

I named my surprise Sol Invictus gift Alaric, the first chihuahua to sack Rome in 800 years. He now shares my household with Odoacer, my Siberian husky. "Odo" as he's usually known is very old now and I fear the auguries are foretelling that the arrival of his namesake in THoR podcast will signal that the end of both is nigh. Thank you for such a fascinating, informative and entertaining podcast. I pray your future may include more, but wish you all the best regardless.

A Chara,

I have been listening to your excellent podcast for a month now. It is hard to believe, but I have enjoyed it so much that I have listened to every single episode up to this in just a month. I was worried you would be finished by the time I caught up, but here we are, in time for the Sack of Rome, the Barbarians at the Gates. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the valuable service and hard work on your part. As someone who writes history, I understand the depth of work that goes into these episodes, and I think it is very important that such work is appreciated. I hope you will go on to do further historical podcasts when you are finished with Rome, but I won't be so presumptuous as to suggest topics. Go n-éirí an bóthar leat.

Regards from Ireland,

Hey Mike,

I love your podcast. I've listen to every episode multiple times over, the story is fascinating. They don't even get old, there are enough to listen to them in an endless loop of entertainment!

I'm so sad that rome has been sacked, but i've been thinking.

You know how constantinple finally falling supposably triggered the rennasiance? Well, i think of it like this - From the ashes of the roman empire, the fall of constantinople triggered the modern era. So Rome is still around... if any of that makes sense.

Sorry to ramble on, im a 16yr old living in pennsylvania i share your podcast with everyone i know and it's great. If i had any real money i'd donate to you regardless of it ending soon or not.

From Muncy Pennsylvania,

Ryan T. Leonard

Finally, I fully understand the fall of the western empire.

I imagine the population in the west is under such fear due to the lack of support.  Are the towns beginning to concentrate on their own self defense independent of the legions? Constantine III showed that helping the Empire is a very bad idea, so I am sure all towns in the west are seeing themselves as being on their own.

Is this the time when what we imagine as an early medieval village begins? Or, is there first the full collapse and destruction of the classical towns, which are then re-invented as the medieval village?

Hi Sandy, if you liked Harris, try 'Imperium' by Mike's fellow Texan and author-historian Steven Saylor. His depiction of the fate of the Pinarii through Claudius to Hadrian brings to mind John Le Carré, Dominitian portrayed very Stalin-like. Highly recommendable. Also, when the West has fallen, there is of course 'The Decline and Fall' by Gibbons unabridged, fabulously read by Bernard Mayes. A great supplement to THoR.

I just got caught up on the previous episode and have been anxiously awaiting this installment.  Then I'm going to start the whole thing over!

I have been to Rome 4 times, and Europe 7.  Next trip is in September 2012.  My great grandfather hailed from Arce in southern Lazio, and we will be staying in the birthplace of Cicero (today known as Arpino, Arpium back in the day).

On my first trip, back in '98, I had no context for the ruins I was seeing.  Every trip has been educational, but nothing compares to the education I received from this poscast.  I can hardly wait to see it again with new eyes.

Hi Mike, excuse my little English:

I've been listening to The History of Rome for over two years now, always a couple of months behind you and I manage to keep the distance by starting over each time I catch up with you. Anyway, thank you for putting together this master piece I truly enjoy it. If you ever finish it, I will keep it safe to pass it on to my two years daughter.

But I must say that the sack of Rome of 410 which I recently eared for the first time was a little disappointing. I understand that the city itself wasn't a major player in the geopolitical world by then, but I was expecting this episode for the very beginning, the day Rome was sacked after 800 hundred years! The siege, the famine, the history of cannibalism going on in the city... well.

Keep the hard work, and I wish I could be on one of your History of Rome Tour, I went to Rome in 2006 and I wish I was then half as knowledgeable as I am today.

Constantinople was sacked before the Ottomans though!
Not to contradict you Mike as you did say by land.
I think it was the forth crusade ( Dandalo's crusade ) that instead of attacking Muslim territory in the holyland, attacked Christian Constantinople instead. The City on this occasion was attacked by sea as the Venetians tied their ships in pairs and built towers that overlooked the massive walls of the city.
It was nothing to do with religion of course it was simply Dandalos revenge

*has a video

Sorry, English majors.

As an apology, have some Rome-relevant photos from my trip to Greece in September this year. :D

Roman coins. I really got a feel for the devaluation of the currency Mike was talking about when they had this room-sized display of various coins. See the fuzzy upper-left corner? They're from the crisis years. They're useless hunks of brown-rusty thrash.. and on the other hand you have coins like these of Augustus or Trajan.

Marco, Mike is technically right because he did say "they would repell any attempt to take Constantinople BY LAND", and the Venitians and the Crusaders actually took Constantinople in 1204 by attacking from the shore, if i remember right my History. It is worth doublechecking though.

Hey Mike, I'm a late follower of the History of Rome. I started back in early 2011 (not sure exactly when) and have just caught up. It's really great!

I have a daughter who is working on Masters in Classics and hoping to go for PhD, so History of Rome has given me a great means to engage her and ask her somewhat informed questions about Roman history. I got her to listen to one of your podcasts--Episode 28, Taking Stock--and she wrote me in an email the following:
"For a general audience, this is very very good. … this is a solid, traditional (quite Polybian) interpretation, and so he won't lead you too far astray."

Just to say, I have really enjoyed the podcast and you have my daughter's seal of approval. Maybe one day I can even make a History of Rome tour. For now, however, I have to finish paying for her graduate school.

Cheers!
Tom Clark

P.S. I definitely want a copy of your book when/if it comes out. Do you offer transcripts purchase?

Another great installment, but like Garret, I grow increasingly nervous as the sack of Rome approaches and the end of new episodes looms large.  Unlike Garret though, I have taken a few precautions and archived all the previous episodes.  Next year I can pretend it is 2008 all over again.

Any recommendations on other solid podcasts on historical subjects?  Unfortunately, Mike's award winning podcast will inevitably come to an end.  I sampled a few other podcasts as potential replacements.  Frankly, I haven't found one that meets the bar set by Mike.  This is not a criticism of other podcasts, it's just Mike set the bar WAY to high.  Can someone recommend a good historical podcast?

Thanks for allowing us to journey not just through Rome's history but your life as we've tagged along with you through a wedding, a major move, the death of a dear family member and several trips to the "Old Country".  It's been a great 3+ years and I'm glad it's not over yet.  Might I humbly recommend "Path Between the Seas" by David McCullough from Audible's library?  The book addresses the building of the Panama Canal and has a very international flavor appealing to many listeners within and beyond the US.  The book won the National Book Award and McCullough's credentials are impeccable with two pulitzers to his credit.

I've only just discovered these podcasts....excellent!

I'm a late Roman reenactor (a member of the largest Late Roman group in the UK with an interesting sideline in gladiatorial games staged on the sites of actual arenas) and have quite a few to get through before I get to this end of Roman history.

Of course, if when you're finished with the end of the Western Empire there's always a 1000 years of stuff in the East to get through if you're at a loose end! ;-)

I wonder how much did the Gauls and Spanish consider themselves as "Roman" , surely they could organize some kind of force to repulse the attack?  Is it just the empire was losing its ability to protect the citizens so that the citizens became indifferent?

I sincerely hope you re-consider your intention, declared at the very beginning, of finishing with the disappearance from record of Romulus Augustus.
Your next one is going to be on the Eastern Empire, so once poor Romulus disappears, continuing with the history of the Eastern Empire until at least the death of Justinian, the last Latin emperor, would be fantastic.
On the other hand, all good things must come to an end, but does that end have to be so nigh?

Thanks for all the hours of info!

i really love this podcast... it is really interesting to see the roots of the subsequent eras taking hold.  i hope you consider tracing the historical memory of rome that has affected subsequent numerous claims to the roman emperor throne all the way through 1800's along with the byzantine throne.  Subjects like Charlemagne and even Napolean, etc.  Or topics like how roman literature affected the dark/middle ages and court life  Anyway, that'd be sick!!  I can't get enough of roman stuff.

Mike,

The end is fast approaching. I would like to request that you let us down easy by tying the podcast up, when the time comes, with at least a few special interest episodes (e.g. gambling games, chariot racing, and gladiatorial combat; cults and priesthoods in ancient Rome; Roman food throughout the empire; You just rambling on about topics that you feel didn't get covered enough, etc.) and maybe a final question blowout.

You are an amazingly gifted storyteller, and you have created a valuable resource for both casual and serious students of history. Thank you so much.

Hi Mike,
Thanks for the wonderfal podcasts. I'm deliberately staying a few podcasts behind the times in case you are forced to take a break or something, so only just listening to these ones. I have a question: you say Constantine III (as he later became) defeated some Saxons in northern Gaul before moving on to secure Gaul. This is getting towards my area of expertise ("Arthurian Britain") but this was a detail about Constantine III I had not heard of. Can you give me a reference? (preferably a primary source). Cheers, Howard.

Hey Mike awesome show, quick question. What is the source you used to assert the premise that the Romans tied up Pyrrus's war elephants like the Imperial walkers at Hoth? I want to be able to effectivelly reference it in the future as a fun factoid. Thanks always for your insanely hard work on the podcast!

Another great episode. I had been unexcited about the end of the Empire: I've been very partial to the late-Republic period. But there is something attractive, now, about the looming collapse. Partially it is because this is how we get from 'there' to 'here', historically. But I think it is also because there are some great figures caught up in this, trying to stem the tide. I've found Stilicho to be a pretty interesting guy.

Cheers

A nitpick, but you mentioned in the last episode that Trier is "located along the lower Rhein," instead of "in the lower Rhein region." Was this just a simplification for the audience? I ask because Trier is actually on the Mosel, and it would have taken a 1-2 day boat ride downriver to get to the Roman fort/settlement of Koblenz at the confluence of the two rivers.

It is only a minor detail, and I only bring this up because a) I am a pedant, and b) I lived in Koblenz for several years, and had often been to Trier, since the ex-wife's grandmother lived a stone-throw away from the ruins of Valentinian I's summer palace in Konz.

Great detail work, Mike Duncan.  It is so sad to see the end of the empire so near. I like the explanation of events here. Most history books just tell you the main events but not the details. It seems that the Romans at this time were still able to fight off barbarians. I always thought that by this time the empire could not handle the mass of barbarians coming to the territories. Because, you know, the high light is the sack of Rome. Also, the Huns were fought earlier than it is popular believe for what you are telling. Not just from Attila, but they came earlier and recognizing the power of Rome. So how come the Huns are not really talked about before Attila, and how they were beaten by the Romans? Anyways great work man.

Wow, things are really winding down for Rome. Late antiquity is such a strange period, one foot in the ancient world, one foot in the middle ages. It's fascinating seeing the fall of the Western Empire narrated practically blow-by-blow in such depth.

Some time ago, (back in the days of the Julio-Claudians in fact,) I posed a question regarding the Sibiline Oracles, and whether they should have some mention since they were a central part of Roman superstition, with origins dating back to Tarquin. No response to that one at the time, but now we have reached that time when the Oracles were supposedly destroyed by Stillico, presumably when he did away with the Pagan cults once and far all. Still no mention of them. Have I overstated their value when it comes to Roman history and culture? Just wondered why they haven't been included in any of the shows.

I got a chill up my spine at the end of this podcast. The thought of such a monumental political entity as Rome collapsing is inconcievable really. It's just too many lives, resources, institutions and ideas bound up together to just... go away. And yet it did.

So I've decided to listen to the entire podcast again from the beginning once things have ended. Your podcast is one of the unique and I hope permanent features of the net, and I am incredibly grateful, Mike, for your having made Roman history accessible to the millions and me.

Other commenters are right - the detail view is remarkable... on the power figures. I just want to know more about how the other 99% of Rome were living also. Do you suppose you could add something more about the actual conditions of life, in addition to the excellent insight into the high-level power politics?

Again, many thanks, Mike.

"The end times are upon us, and the walls are crumbling down."

Your narration really shone in this episode, Mike.  That last line was spoken with just the right note of ominous-sounding gravitas- so much so that I almost could feel the chill wind blowing.  I could almost hear somebody like James Earl Jones narrating it, though someone like that might have gone over the top.

You've nailed it in this series overall, I think; finding just the right balance between humor and sarcastic modern irony on the one hand and sober historical drama on the other.  This series has been extremely educational and entertaining without being overly scholarly (and thereby stuffy and boring).

Bravo, sir.  A tip o' my hat to thee.

Part of the problem is that I still visualize Romans of this time as "Classic" Romans, and it felt odd a while back when the Emperors just decided not to live in Rome anymore.

I don't have a clear vision of how the society has changed, how the City of Rome has changed.  The story is very much a procession of names and battles.

I know you have tried to point out how the army has become more and more Gothic, and how the various provinces have become more independent to the point of regularly being essentially separate entities.

But it's hard to visualize.

I know I've banged on about this before, but as we get closer to Odaocer and all that, I'd like a break from the narrative and, if it's at all possible Mike, a bit of time spent discussing socio-economic factors that had enfeebled the empire. You don't really get that in a high politics based narrative. A few weeks ago you said how Valentinian failed to grasp the way the empire had changed since the first centurt AD. To be honest, I'm not sure how the empire had changed either. You've touched on issues such as the difficulty in recruiting and way back you talked about Diocletians financial reforms and how they helped remove the rich from civic life but I'b like more of this and it all brought together in one place. Hope you're recovered now.

Interesting as always.

One question that's been popping around in my head ever since the Germanic generals starting becoming so important in the Roman Empire is how "Romanized" were these Germanic generals?  Would they have dressed as a Roman?  Would they have spoke Latin as a Roman?  What identified them as German?  Just the name?

I also find it interesting that Stilicho never "Romanized" his name.  Compare this to earlier times when other barbarians "Romanized" their names. Some even became emperor (e.g Philip the Arab).

@ Guy Moloney: Actually I'd say that's the point. Furthering the understanding of the Empire itself before it perishes into the annals of History. Build on the concept of what exactly it is that is being destroyed.

Not a lot of narritives that go for "And here we see the woman getting shot....and now we'll show you the rest of her life before that so you understand why you should've been sad when it happened, even though you didn't care about it at the time", even though we obviously do know a lot by now, but presumably it's still quite a different beast. :)

I vote for getting up to speed on how the Empire is at the moment before the episodes "ending" the series. Also hoping for some Specialized episodes that delve deeper into specific topics or people without maintaining a strict storyline. Amongst podcasts Mike is naturally the master of keeping it nice and straight, but since it's rapidly nearing the end of that line (and he has stated his lack of intent of continuing with the east, though hopefully that'll change!) it'd be lovely to at least have some more of that. <3

A note on that last thing, since I realized it doesn't say it explicitly: I meant for more focused looks into individual topics throughout Roman history (or effects of it on whenever) after the end of the Series, but for the stuff explaining this particular period in time before the end.

I'm a big fan of the show and I agree I would like to see some episodes on the cultural aspects of the empire and of the people outside of the empire. One thing I wish I had a better understanding of is at what point does Christianity become the majority religion of the empire. In addition the Christianization of the barbarian tribes would be an interesting subject to me. If these could be covered at all it would be greatly appreciated.

@Mainframe: I understand your point.  How it feels to me is that the narrative of Roman history is just so messy in the late 4th/early 5th century that it's all Mike can do to keep us accurately informed of the major events and players shaping the empire at this decidedly wobbly stage.  It made sense to take stock around ep.28 after they'd dealt with their local rivals, and again after they'd attained some stability throughout the 2nd century.  What it meant to be Roman seemed much more easily quantifiable. Now it seems in such a state of flux that stopping at the hammer blow of the 410 sack to catch a breath would make sense to me.

So here's my question - what the heck were the actual, you know, Romans doing during all of this?  Its pretty clear that the empire is now being ruled by people who are everything but natives of Rome proper - or even Italy proper. This was a population that for 600 or so years clawed over each other to achieve power, conquer the world, and "Romanize" every civilization they came in contact with. Where were ambitious young Romans directing their once enormous political energies?  One would think that at some point people living in and around Rome would wake up and realize that they weren't in control of their own empire anymore, and try to do something about it.  I think it would be a fascinating topic to discuss, as The History of the Rome has obviously (as did the empire) followed the course of history away from the eternal city for quite some time now.

Great show - i've been a listener from the beginning and applaud your amazing work.

Hi, Mike. Ryan from Indianapolis here, long time listener.  If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to put in an episode request.  Before the empire goes on hospice, can you do another Day-in-the-Life episode?  I think it would be interesting to see how much things have changed since the last one, which i think you did back when the Antonines were in power...

I don't think historians could ever agree on where and when the Byzantine empire kicks off.  Historian Lars Brownnworth includes Constantine and Julian in his 12 Byzantine Rulers.  In the instance of Constantine I understand his inclusion: he created the capital that bears his name and that for a millennium was the center of the extant empire.  Including Juliann though is a mystery.  He was the most Hellenistic of emperors and therefore most emphatically western.

I don't think you really need the term Byzantine until Rome falls and is sacked in the 5th century.  The West then devolves into fiefdoms and the eastern portion of The Roman Empire carries on as before.  But without Rome as a locus.   Add to the confusion the fact that the Byzantines would never consider themselves Byzantine.  The term would be absolutely alien to them.  They considered themselves Roman and the caretakers of the Roman Empire.  Even though Rome had fallen and they now spoke Greek.

Soooooo.  I think the Byzantine Empire is an historical construct that modern day readers use to distinguish the Roman Empire of the east that carries on after the fall of the west.   But no doubt others think otherwise....Good luck.

I also wanted to add my voice to ryan's suggestions about day-in-the life episode for the late roman period. I imagine that a roman from the days of the republic would find the late roman empire a very alien place.

@ Laurence
100% correct. They were Romans and considered  themselves Roman. We only use the term Byzantine so that we know that we're talking about Medieval Romans and not Classical Romans. Furthermore, we use the older city name, Byzantium and therefore Byzantines, because using Constantinoplians is far too unwieldy.

Hi Mike, Echoing Alex and Ryan's requests above and some others from the past few weeks for a "day in the life episode" - I agree that would be great. Seeing as we're already up to 394, it might be too late to recommend "428 AD: An Ordinary Year at the End of the Roman Empire" by Giusto Traina, but this is a really nice (and reasonably short) march through the empire and its surroundings, starting in Armenia and traveling counter-clockwise around the Mediterranean to end in Persia.  Nothing much happened in this year (excepting the permanent loss of Armenia, hushed up by the Byzantine chroniclers), but of course next year is 429 and the advent of everyone's favorite East Germanic property destroyers, so it's a nice moment to take stock.

Absolutely love the show -- without question, my favorite podcast.  Vale!

Hi Mike,

It seems like the wealth of the empire and the living standard of  Roman citizens has fallen heavily since the peak around Marcus Aurelius. Armies are smaller, I haven't picked up on any new grand monuments in a while, and all-in-all it sounds like the average Roman is worse off.

Could you give a few comparisons on how low they've really fallen?  With the decline so gradual it's hard to understand the full difference from those episodes way back.

Hi.

Glad you're getting better.

I've listened to all the pod-casts and find them entertaining & informative.  It makes the journey to/from work go past very quickly.  Keep up the good work.

Listening to other history podcasts, I find few that come up to Mike's standards.

My only whinge is the use of place names.  Mike uses Rome, Milan, Paris, London, Constantinople etc but for reasons best known to himself, talks of the city of Thessaloniki / Salonica as Thessalonica - neither Greek nor English.  In English, it is Salonica and there are many English references especially with regards to WW1 ("the Gardeners of Salonica").  Alternatively, use the Greek place name, Thessaloniki though this would be inconsistent with using all the other English exonyms.

@ John D.  Wait wait wait. How is "Paris" coming from English alone? It's "Paris" in French!

Also the first line in Wikipedia on the city is: "Thessaloniki (Greek: Θεσσαλονίκη [θesaloˈnici] ( listen)), historically also known as ----THESSALONICA----, Salonika or Salonica"

..So presumably he's just reading it as it is in the histories, given that it's a historical name for it and the Latin form, and Salonica itself (a name I haven't really ever heard for the city. Presumably Thessaloniki is the more common english form, given that it's the article's name) is also in the article said to derive from a Greek pet-name for the city.

It's a relief to have the podcast back. It's hard to picture Christians and pagans existing in a situation where Christians would placate pagans with their symbols returned to the Senate building. I think after you dispatch Arbogast that we need a cultural episodes to illustrate just what the western and eastern cultures looked like.

BTW, I thought Romans committed suicide by short sword. Is hanging a new custom, or just convenient for Valentinian II?

Hi Mike.

I have a question on something you said in this week's podcast.  You said that Arbogast knew he couldn't become emperor himself, due to the fact that he was a Frank.  But why should that stop him?  Everyone in the empire has been a citizen since 212, right?  And emperors have come from all over the place, from Spain, Illyria, Africa, and beyond.  Is there some sort of perhaps new institutionalized racism in the Roman empire at this point in history?

Thanks,
-Neil

Mike, hope you're back to full strength, we need your work!  On a different note, I was wondering if you could say a few lines on what the linguistic map of the empire looked like during this time.  Was it Latin west/Greek east?  How deep were the divisions between what was spoken in Gaul/Hispania/Africa/etc?

Thanks for your hard work and saludos from Hispania!

Hope you are feeling better, look after yourself. I am sure I speak for all listeners when I say, don't force yourself. The fall of Rome has waited 1600 odd years, I am sure we can wait another week while you recover.
Am dreading the end. Is there any way we can convince you to recalibrate the end of the history of Rome. There are other alternatives to Romulus Augustus: 1453, Last Holy Roman Emperor, Berlusconi, he does represent the end of times in so many ways, it would seem appropriate.

I knew it!  I saw a flock of birds flying  erratically and wondered what was up.  So that's what the auspices were trying to say.  So what did they use?  The Promethean technique is probably the most appropriate given the circumstances.  But sometimes it's difficult finding a large enough rock when you need it.

Get well soon, mate!

You're not allowed to fall until after the Empire falls. And we're all dreading the day.

I went on a History of Rome fast recently so I have about six or seven precious episodes on which I intend to feast some day.

To all those who groaned when they found no episode this week, History of Rome is addictive. Listen to it in moderation.

Ah, as to whether the footnotes had been removed, it took me a few minutes to get in on the joke but, in my uninformed opinion, if you're gonna take out the appendix you might as well take out the footnotes, too. :)

I've been there man. With an appendix surgery, I was tied up for a good four days. Take care. And make sure that you negotiate down the hospital bill once they give it to you. It'll be a doozy.

Also, I share Luke Baxter's assessment. A recalibration of the end of the Roman empire would certainly benefit the other listeners and myself. With less than 100 years before the stated end, maybe something to consider:

Some options for an "alternate ending":

-565: The death of Justinian (if I'm not mistaken, the last Latin speaking Roman Emperor and the last Roman Emperor of the Italian peninsula)

-May 29th, 1453 (Fall of Constantinople and symbolic end of the Byzantine Empire)

-The end of WW1 (the end of the Kaiser and the Tsar, both rooted from Caesar, also the end of the Ottoman Sultan who may have still claimed the title Caesar of Rome) [okay wishful thinking probably, but I'd still listen every week]

 Feel better Mike.  Flirt with the nurses and make them laugh .  You'll find yourself getting a little more of everything you need .   And don't forget to work this pain and trauma into a damn good care package .  Your family should understand that only an iPad2 will help you past the wrenching experience of having your appendix torn away :)

Get well soon.  We will survive without our weekly dose of THoR.  It will be hard but we will make it.  God's speed on you recovery.  We can listen to old episodes until then.

Mike I'm so glad you're ok, appendix is not a good thing and tho mod med is amazing - abdominal cavity is a tricky place!

sending good vibs for a speedy recovery (not in a selfish way - the cast'll be back, but more in a being healthy is so great and lousy when you feel kak way).

Tho we are all waiting with bated breath for the next installment, WE CAN WAIT!!! don't push yourself and don't worry we're all so addicted we'll be ready when you are...

I'm sure yr wife, family and friends are gathered round to amuse and distract you from your patient-ness. Enjoy the attention!

Get well soon!

Also, when next taking heavy antibiotics treatment for some reason don't forget to mention you had your appendix removed. The appendix stores a 'sample' of your intestinal flora when all the rest is destroyed by antibiotics, so without appendix you might get complications.
Free medical advice for you. Hey, you gave me plenty of free podcasts!

Maybe this would be the appropriate time to suggest some "Special" episodes again. Ala the Taking stock episodes in the second century.

One that comes to mind would be: "Medicine in Ancient Rome". I have also had my appendix removed and sometimes ponders on how short my life would have been if I was born in another time.

Well, blinkin' flip, looked in to download my usual episode and I find all this. Your health is important but so is the podcast: do you have a deputy?

Come to think of it, hope you have health insurance? Us Hayekian serfs in thrall to the faceless bureaucratic runaway superstate over here in the UK get socialised medicine and can get our appendixes whipped out more or less whenever.

Get well as soon as is convenient.

I've only recently discovered History of Rome and have been listening to an episode each evening on my drive home from work. I love it. As I have only reached episode 59 I am in the fortunate position of being able to not worry about the fact there won't be an episode this week or for as many weeks as it takes you to get better.  But soon that day will come...

History of Rome has documented many rebellions within the body politic.  Glad to see this literal one turned out okay.

One thing that I would like to hear a little bit more. In the comming years there will be sacking of the roman empire.

I come from the place that was south Panonia and I really do not know anything about the history of these places between late roman empire while it was still working till the Karlo the Great which is few centuries of total black hole.
What was with the people and economy of these places after this place was sacked by Goths and then Huns and Avars and at the end Slavs. This place was like highway between Constantinopol and Italy/Rome.

horrary for Mike, thank you so much - i love the podcast and have been listening for ages! unfortunately the itunes doesn't allow me to organize them on my ipod in order, don't understand why?? but i run through them as i am renovating my house...plus been recommending the cast to everyone i meet...

hope you will eventually sort out a book to accompany the pod cast, I know that's a tall order...
thanks again and cheers!

You seem to be leaning too heavily on Gibbon; his anti-Christian bias is showing in your narrative.  The events leading to the destruction of the Serapeum were far more complex than you led on.  And it's generally accepted now, is it not, that Gibbon was wrong in saying the mob also destroyed the Alexandrian daughter library?

I don't know where you're getting that from, sdf. There's only half of a sentence on the wiki that even suggests that it isn't a plausible explanation and it has a [Citation Needed] tag for not showing a source for that claim. As far as I know no-one has evidence for how the library came to it's end and that it survived in one crippled version after another with successive events. Whether the Christian riots were the final death-stroke or not, it does seem a reasonable candidate (where-as the Islamic conquest being set as the date is usually considered propaganda?).

(And you note his Anti-Christian bias, but keep in mind that there'll also be incredibly heavy pro-Christian bias in other histories. Especially when written and copied by Christian institutions for millennia.)

As a Catholic priest, I've noticed that what is sometimes called an "Anti Christian" bias is, in fact, a cultural bias.  We take the values we have learned and hold now and wonder how anybody could have missed this before.
Based on Mr. Duncan's extremely respectful handling of Christian/Theological issues in the past, I would consider the possibility of a cultural bias long before I would consider an anti Christian one.  Just my two cents.

Frjoe,
I was referring to Gibbons' (undeniable) anti-Christian bias, not accusing Mr. Duncan of holding one himself.  Over-reliance on Gibbon for the historical narrative concerning the early Christians is going to unavoidably carry the echo of his bias (and some of his resulting false conclusions, e.g. concerning the destruction of the Alexandrian library).

Heh. Yeah, I'll agree with Joe on that point. It's very often values dissonance causing a new look on ancient individuals, even if in this case he did blame the Christians as part of the reason (and a sickness at the root of maintaining the Empire) for why it fell, since he considered them to have lessened their concerns for the here and now, since it was fairly commonly believed that the second coming was right around the corner and even if it wasn't the earthly life was irrelevant anyway.

I also don't like the fact that he personally didn't suck up to the faction he believed was a cause of the decline and fall being stated as a "bias" (even if it was quite possibly incorrect, given how the East lived on, but we'll never know. *Waves goodbye to Julian*). It was just a conclusion that he reached when he saw the start of the decline and what effects he considered Christianity to have.

If you look at the Wiki article for the fall of the Alexandrian Library, for instance since I just recently looked over it, then on the Talk-page there's a muslim complaining about it's "Islamophobic lies" because it, as it should, notes one of the major accounts in the histories. Not saying it is the correct one, just noting it. Because anything that doesn't hold their Jihadist conquerors up as beacons of enlightenment and perfect holy men is automatically bigoted or racist. It's the kind of attitude it breeds. Even if he's entirely wrong in his hypothesis that doesn't necessarily mean he was incapable of fair judgment due to pre-existing prejudice.

I'm not all that familiar with Gibbon's personal life, but whether that's the case or not just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they're biased. They could just be wrong (or right, naturally). :)

(But stop repeating that "False conclusion that the Christians ruined the library". Show an actual source. "[Citation Needed]" to assert that as true when it's such a non-settled issue.)

Umm, Mike?  It's "penitent", not "penTitent".  At first I thought that was just a typo- you have it spelled correctly in your title, but not in the hyperlink.  But then when I listened, you pronounced it "penTitent", too, with the extra "T" in there.  Not that anyone else would have noticed this.  Just thought you might wanna know, is all.

OK.  Sorry for the triple reply, especially after promising to shut up.  I've listened to the episode, now, and learned a bit- thanks.

@Chris- I thought he was referring to Henry II of England, too (there are parallels with THAT King Henry showing penitence after the whole Thomas à Becket debacle), but no, Mike was referring to Henry IV, Holy Roman emperor, of whom I had not heard.  I had to Wikipedize (my new verb- like it?) ... I had to look "Canossa" up.  Fortuitously, it mentions Henry IV in the article.

Anti-Christian bias? Well the transformation of Christianity in the late empire is undoubtedly important, and to not take a position on it or ignore it seems absurd to me.

Such a huge transformation definately had some sort of effect on the stability of the late empire, and to simply ignore that seems to be putting one´s head in the sand. I suppose you might even be able to make a positive or neutral argument for what Christianity was to the Roman state in the end, but to simply blithely ignore it and accept it in itself as neutral strikes me as wrongheaded. You have to deal with it as the huge social and political transformation it was.

I, personally, think it probably was a toxic thing to the empire and toxic to the intellectual life of the west for thousands of years. Just ask Hypatia.

Andre,
I said nothing about judging the effects of Christianity upon the empire, only warned against over-reliance on Gibbons concerning the early centuries of the Church.  His naive infatuation with classical paganism and impenetrable cynicism regarding the Church's telling of its own history were the height of intellectual fashionability in his day so the blind spot is perhaps excusable; excusable or not, though, it tarnishes this portion of his narrative which shouldn't be relied on exclusively or uncritically.

Hi, Mike, your podcasts are great! I'd been listening to them for a few months a year ago, but then I had a break, and I hope now it's over. Yesterday I downloaded all missing episodes, from 44-th and to this one, 156-th, and now I'm ready to devote at least an hour every day for your creation. I'm from Ukraine, Kiev - and I'm promoting your series among my friends, particularly as a wonderful way to improve one's English. So, I'd like to express my profound gratitude for your work and wish you a successful ending of your excellently told Roman history.

I've enjoyed your podcasts for a few months now.  I'm wondering how long or how far into the fall you'll actually go.  Beyond the 450's maybe?  You'll continue through the Byzantine Empire possibly?

Has anybody constructed a list of Emperiors and a thumbnail of their accomplishments yet?  I'm thinking of running through your podcasts once more to do so but don't want to if somebody has already done this.

Mike has repeatedly stated that he will not be covering the Byzantine Empire as he simply isn't as familiar with it as he with the Roman Empire that ended on 4 September 476.

His next historical podcast project is one that will cover the various political eras of American history.

Mike, I keep up with you every week.  This is one of your funnier episodes.

Just finished the first two season's of "Rome" (the HBO/BBC series) on CD.  Now I have to go back to your podcasts covering the 44 BC period of Caesar (Gaius) and Caesar (Octavian) to see just how much of the "Rome" series agrees with history.

I did have a couple questions:

They show the "inhaling" of hemp (by Octavia) with a tube.  That is believable and agrees with Martin Booth's "Cannabis: A History."

But what I have a hard time believing is the smoking of opium in a pipe by Cleopatra and Mark Antony, et al.  It was my understanding that "smoking" was unknown until the American Indians were discovered smoking tobacco about 500 years ago.

Can you (or anyone) confirm or deny this information?  Any opium pipes found from 2000 years ago?

Excellent episode as always!

@ Anthony and Carlos about 'The City of God' reference. Augustine DID write 'The City of God', but Ambrose was a pivotal figure in Augustine's conversion to Christianity. Ambrose even baptized Augustine. So I took the reference to mean that without Ambrose's influence, Augustine would have remained a happy pagan and we would all have been spared having to read the book.

 Excellent Podcast as always. We are now reaching the point of the beginning of the end for the Western Empire. The usurper Magnus Maximus would be the last strong Emperor to hold sway over the Western Empire. Afterwards the Western Empire would be ruled by weak and ineffective Emperors ruling an increasingly smaller empire. It is sad to see Rome at this time only a shadow of it's former glorious self. Perhaps Stilicho or Aetius could have turned it around. We will never know.

Loved the nugget on the "Altar of Victory" and your Indiana Jones aside.

The discovery of the Altar would have been more in line with the heroic archeologist protecting us from relics of the past too powerful to allow to fall into enemy hands. I also was disappointed that the films returned to Christianity in the 3rd film and would have rather have had another culture's relic explored, Shinto maybe.

Again awesome idea.

I agree with the Indy comment.  It's those asides that just makes the whole series entertaining as well as educational (which of course means I learn more!)

One suggestion, I'd like to hear a couple more references to modern geographical locations to help me picture the events more clearly.  It was so cool to hear Heidelberg and the Rhine mentioned recently as I left Heidelberg to cross the Rhine on the train!

I'd never heard of St Ambrose until this episode. Honestly! Some of us listeners of THOR happen to come from non-Christian worlds so we are not that well informed as to who brought down the Roman Empire. We like to think it was us barbarians whodunit. :)

It is also noteworthy that the name 'Hitler' suddenly makes an appearance on the show. I am sure Godwin's Law was breached quite unintentionally here. No one in their right mind would compare St Ambrose with Hitler now, would they? Apart from bringing down thousand-year-reichs, they have nothing in common.

The best bits in this crackling episode concerned the fate of the Altar of Victory. Another piece of Roman soul disappears. The end is nigh!

re Magnus Maximus... what a great, great name!

We're going around the last bend and it won't be long before we're on the home straight. Mike, you said a while back you didn't want the podcast to just be a history of the emperors. I'd be very interested if you would consider a more thematic approach when looking at the final collapse. I don't want to just know what happened in the 470s but the long (as well as short) term causes of the fall of the western empire. Narrative has its place but I'd like a bit more than that.

This episode actually has mentioning of the feudal style way of life. The large land owners think that they can brush-off the imperator by not doing what the state says, bring about the collapse of the empire. Something like the US, when GE was just a small company, IBM, and many other large corporation. They all start small and humble until they grow powerful and have a saying in policies.

It's sad to see the Western Roman Empire coming to an end, so why go there?  Just invent a great Comeback.

Augustilius turns out to be a brave, effective leader who organizes an heroic defense of Rome, defeats the Visigoths and starts a new glorious phase in Roman History.

Just 'cos it says Rome falls in books doesn't mean it has to be so.

I've been deeply enchanted by this podcast for well over a year now. Unlike some others above I actually feel a sense of satisfaction and comfort knowing that the story has an end, and that end is near.  While I will sincerely miss the warm, engrossing style that Mike gives to the story of Rome, all good things must have an end.  The story could be continued on all the way up until the present day, if we really wanted to keep track of the European narrative that far.  Then Mike would have to give us a day to day update, as the world moved on.  That, I suppose, would just be the news.  Might as well just stick with CNN.  Having our story end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire gives it a nice tight closing point, and takes us out of the steam of a constantly changing world and into a story that feels like one solid, if operatic, song.  Thank you Mike, and please let us know what project you are moving onto next.  The more of you we can get, the better!  Would follow you on to new podcasts, or buy your book, or purchase your new "Roman War Songs, the Greatest Hits" album...  whatever.

Thanks as ever Mike.  I feel that the episodes since the appearance  of Julian have been a real high point for the podcast.  The question that I have is why did the loss of  such a relatively small army at Adrianople have such a lasting effect on the balance of power?  Its not on the same sheer scale of the defeats by Hannibal (for instance), where the armies were so much bigger.  Were the legions just so depleted and reliant on barbarians that this battle was a tipping point? I'd love to hear anyones thoughts on this.

Hey Mike,

Thanks for the clarification on the Hun bows. Before modern compound bows came about, the term "compound bow" was used to refer to some recurve bows made of composite materials like the ones the Huns used. If you have been reading older accounts, (particularly anything with E.A. Thompson's name on it) it's likely you saw a reference to "the Hun compound bow" in print somewhere.

Hey, Mike, as an Audible recommendation, choose Justinian's Flea, which may be the single most enjoyable history book I have ever listened to.

What Hath God Wrought is also a fantastic audiobook, although it is American history.

Lastly, Empire of the Sea, which traces the battle for the Med from the fall of Rhodes through the Siege of Malta through the Battle of Lepanto.

All of these are awesome reads that I got on my Audible on the extreme cheap and all made long car rides just enjoyable

What a great series Mike has given us. With it's delightful quirks and anecdotes, I am greatly reminded of the late Colin McEvedy's series of Penguin historical atlases from the 1980s.

One of the bonuses I get is hearing someone pronounce the Latin.. oh, that's how you say it!

In homage to Mike's opus, I offer my own contribution for anyone interested: a pdf poster of the Roman emperors (A1 paper size, 841x594mm). Every time I listen to a new episode I update it, but there you go.

Audible recommendation:
The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli.
There are several versions available, I listened to samples of all of them and liked best the unabridged version read by Fritz Weaver.  Weaver has a "Christopher Lee"-like quality to his voice that really captures the dark and intriguing content of the book.

Machiavelli mentions numerous examples from Roman history to illustrate his points.  The Prince is not as evil as its reputation implies.  I found it much more interesting to hear the whole uncut work rather than hearing quotes taken out of context.

I have been listening to this podcast since 2007...I can't believe this is the first time I've commented.  Love the show!  -Mark

"Valens was 50 years old and had ruled the eastern half of the empire for 14 years."

or

"Emperor X was Y years old and had ruled the empire for Z years"

I love these simple closures to each reign.

They are usually followed by a brief legacy of the said dead emperor.

... and they show what a great, methodical show runner this show runner is.

For any who come across this page and see the reference to Mike's Latin pronunciation, I wanted to alert them that those pronunciations are often incorrect or divergent from standard.  His pronunciations of things beyond Latin often miss the mark, as well. "Antiochus," "Agricola," and many other things are pronounced incorrectly. You would be wise to double-check before taking Mike's pronunciations as gospel.

Still, it is a fun podcast, despite the frequent mispronunciations and occasional factual errors.

Audible rec.-- Into Africa: The Epic Adventures of Stanley and Livingstone by Martin Dugard

The fascinating story behind the famous quotation, "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"

Read by (sometimes voice-actor) John Lee, who does a great job w/ the accents for the quotations.  Well written, easy listening.

<a href="http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V5A1JC">http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002V5A1JC</a>


p.s.-Thanks for giving the whole Valens & the Goths (*not a rock band*) story a fair hearing--we never seem to hear anything but the short-hand account in school.

At about the 9:40 mark, Mike Duncan gives a shout-out to the historian Peter Heather. By coincidence I just finished reading Heather's 'The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History'. (I can't find it on audible, unfortunately.) I don't know if anyone recommended it before, but it's a gripping and informative read.

A Song of Ice and Fire, which is a fantasy series by George R.R. Martin (which has recently been adapted into a miniseries by HBO called "Game of Thrones," the title of the first book). It has nothing to do with Roman history per se, however the style of the books are semi historical in nature, and many of the themes draw clear influences from ancient Rome (for example, the fallen city of Valyria). A must read for any fantasy fan, and really any fan of literature in general.

Ah, the earthquake, storm and tidal wave generating Huns :). Talking about the Huns, I recommend Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August as read by Nadia May - excellent narration. There is another version also available on Audible but I have not heard it.

If I can make a second recommendation: 1776 by David McCullough (narrated by the author).

Not quite Ancient History in either case but still history.

Welcome back Mike. :)

Audible has an abridged version of Dante's Inferno narrated by the fantastic voice of John Cleese that's well worth a lesson.

The Aeneid narrated by Simon Callow is fantastic.

Greg Wise narrating The Picture of Dorian Gray is good.

Hellas by Cyril Robinson is a relatively brief history of ancient Greece I found pretty easy to get into and understand.

Thanks for a great episode!

Mike,

If you haven't already suggested it, I would highly recommend "The Ghosts of Cannae" by Robert O'Connell. Much farther back in Roman history than we are now, but it is an incredibly engaging read on the Punic wars from the perspective of humanity - its strengths and frailties.  O'Connell starts with the human impetus for waging war and unrolls the story of Barcids, the Scipiones, and the survivors of Republican Rome's greatest defeats with a depth of calrity that I have never read.

In other words...a good read!

And they have it on audible...

Can I 2nd David's suggestion about the warrior of Rome series. I havn't listened to it on audiobook but the "normal" book is very good. It hasn't got the latest on there yet but I'm sure it will come. I will also wanted to recommend the Simon Scarrow roman history series of books but only 3 are in english. So I will put that as a recommendations if you only want some as audio book or in english.

Wow.  FINALLY caught up!  I started following this in March and it's now great to be "in real time."  One of the great things I love about this series is Mike's ability to get into the psychology & underlying motivations of many of these "power plays" that dictate the ebb & flow of the Roman Empire.  It also drives home the point that human nature has basically remained unchanged in 2,000 years.  That being said, I have my audio book suggestion:

The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

<a href="http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002VA8IXS">http://www.audible.com/pd?asin=B002VA8IXS</a>

It's essentially a modern day "Art of War" and synthesizes the theories of Sun-tsu, Machiavelli, Carl von Clausewitz etc.  For each "rule" it gives excellent historical examples of when the rule was observed to great effect and when when the rule was ignored to somebody's great peril. Examples include Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, and even PT Barnum.

Audible rec.- "The Guns of August" by Barbara Tuchman.  (Or "The Zimmerman Telegram" by the same author.)  The former is perhaps THE book to read about the lead-up to WW1.  (I was gonna recommend "Dreadnought" by Robert Massey, but it seems they don't have that.)

The latest episode was available on iTunes as of Sunday afternoon. I'm not sure why the blog isn't updated.

Anyway...My recommendation:
There's a book that was just made available on Audible format. It's about the Peleponnesian War - a fascinating time period. If you're feeling brave you can recommend it: It's by Donald Kagan ;-)

This is my first comment on this great series of podcasts. Please don't let my embroidery blog fool you, I'm a great fan of Roman History and have been so for many years. Right now I'm reading "Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization" that I picked up at the Borders sale. I find it a bit slow, but still interesting. It is available on Audible so I think it's worth recommending, especially since it is about a worthy opponent of Rome. I find it very strange that we always remember the generals who lost (Hannibal), but seldom know those who won (Scipio Africanus).

Keep up the great posts, and where is Episode 153? :)

Audible rec:
The Egyptian Volumes 1 and 2 by Mika Waltari.

The Egyptian is doubtly one of the greatest historical novels of all time and it was a big international bestseller during the '50's. The book set in during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.

I haven't actually listened this version though, but have read the book at least three times by now and enjoyed it each time very much.

Almost caught up withthe podcast. First thank you for the time and effort you have put into this. It's amazing. I have a non-Rome audible book to recommend. Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan, the Japanese Navy's Story. written by Mitsuo Fuchida & Masatake Okumiya (two of the pilots that were there). It's was interesting to hear what the Japanese side of how the battle was suppose to go and what happened when it didn't.

In a fit of wretched grief attributable to this announcement, I recreated the Battle of Cannae on I-694 in Minnesota today.  My 2000 Mercedes ML played the role of Hasdrubal.  Given my inablitity to find suitable Roman Legion garb for a small SUV on short notice, I duct taped a windshield scrapper to the hood in such a way that the red brush faced upward.

I have had he opportunity to hear the whole thing at my leisure over the last few months without he suspense of waiting for  a week and the next installment. So here I am,  all caught up and checking out Gibbom. A whole world has opened  for me. This is a very cool endeavor you chosen to pursue.    Many thanks.

I want to know, how serious was the population crisis during the late fourth century for the Romans to be so reliant on Germanic troops?

It seems odd that the Romans of the First and Second Punic wars were able to field armies (and fleets) of over 50,000 on multiple occasions with only the manpower of the Italian peninsula. But with the whole populations of the East, Valens was still reliant on Gothic levies in order to field his legions. Surely the populations of the East of the 4th century CE vastly outnumbered the population of Italy in the 3rd century BCE, right? So why the reliance on non-Roman soldiers to wage their wars?

@ Miguel I think this was addressed a few episodes back in relation to the plagues that swept through the empire and greatly diminished the population and the possible recruit numbers. From memory it was called the Antonine plague but I am open to correction on any of this.

@Miguel It also wasn't so much a population crisis as it was a lack of interest in the military by the people in the Roman Empire; in fact there were numerous reports during  the 4th century of people trying to avoid military service by cutting off their fingers to make themselves ineligible.

Another reason that I learned from a book by the author Peter Heather is that it wasn't necessarily that there were more germanic troops in the military, but that they ceased to be called auxillaries in the later years and were merely grouped with the rest of the roman solidiers.

Hope I could help :)

That works for me.
The Empire, and especially the land near it's borders wasn't about the City of Rome anymore.  The Emperors didn't even bother to visit there.

The soldiers on the Danube didn't care what was going on down in Italy, and vice versa.  And after several hundred years, the once conquered lands of the Empire are now just as much part of the it as anywhere else.

So you get your troops from whatever region will supply them.

To add to Ben in response to miguel...

The population of a very Marshal population of Italy during the republic and the population of now a passive Roman Empire is not the same.

The provinces aside from the border lands are ran by  powerful nobles who would never let their own clients enlist.

Long time listener, first time commenter:

I know the next few episodes are probably spoken for, but some time soon can we step back from the relentless march of history and take a look around at the empire?  I remember we looked at life in Rome, many episodes back;  I think it was in the early empire.  It would be really good to review how things have changed since then.

What is life like for a normal citizen of the empire?  What do they spend their days doing?  What is the economy like? How about the army?  Does anybody even feel part of a greater 'whole' anymore?  Would a citizen from Britiania or Gaul, even recognise somebody from the eastern provinces as being part of the same empire?  Would they speak a common language?  Eat similar food?  Use the same currency?

After all the changes of the past few hundred years, it would be very nice to stop and have a look around.

Note that Mike said in this episode that after Valentinian, emperors didn't actively participate in campaigns etc, leaving this to generals instead.  Two exceptions in the West spring to mind.

Constantius III - vigorous general who could have held West together a bit longer, but went and died 6 months after being proclaimed emperor.

Majorian - vigorous general who could have held West together had he been born 20 years earlier, but by his time (d. 461) all too late

After the last episode (Ep150) and with the way it ended I thought Mike was going to spend one episode in each half of the empire from now on.

Splitting the narrative this way would capture the growing East/West division so much better and I assumed Mike was on to this already.

In this episode, I expected to be in the eastern empire spending all the time with Valens and his troubles.

Then the narrative returned from Valens in the east to Valentinian in the west 2/3 in to the episode. Why didn't the episode just end there?

Finding out what happened to Valentinian in this episode felt somewhat anti-climactic, to be frank.

I am still seven or eight weeks behind so it is possible that Mike may have already done the logical thing and split the narrative. That worked very well in the past when Julius Ceasar was campaigning in Gaul and Crassus in Mesopotamia.

Just my two sestertius' worth.

I have spent the last four months listening to the episodes while walking my dog...I have one of the best conditioned dogs in town!  I should be completely caught up by mid February but after listening to this episode today I am feeling a little scared for the future of Rome!  There seems to be an ominous foreshadowing that gives me the feeling this is not going to turn out well for Rome.  Don't tell, I don't want to ruin the ending!  I am hoping for a Disney-esque end.....

Hello Michael,

As you are preparing THOR podcasts, I realized that you are coming close to the time of Augustine of Hippo. He was living in Africa, and as you said in the last podcast (number 150): for Rome in Africa the writing was on the walls. This is the inspiration for his book City of God, which posits that the temporal Rome would soon be replaced by the Spiritual Rome... the Catholic Church. I don't know if this fits into what you had planned, but I figured this is the right time to bring it up.

I like that even with the West in a death spiral, the Empire thoroughly Christianized, and the sinews of the approaching Middle Ages starting to show through the crumbling facade of Antiquity, Rome and Persia are still about to fight yet another war over who gets to be Armenia's BFF.

Is it just me or is this a rather tedious period of the empire. Slow inevitable decline in the power of the emperors, the barbarians’ steady and relentless pressure. Despite Mike’s enthusiasm for the subject… it is hard work making these present Augustus interesting.

I've heard the Republic/Early Empire stories so many times before but this is all new stuff for me and its very interesting. He's doing a good job of showing that the "barbarians" weren't that barbaric. They were consistently trouncing the Roman's on the field.

I think its important that people keep an open mind when it comes to learning about unfamiliar areas of world history.

A wise man once said something like "those who forget history are doomed to learn about Nazis and Romans forever." :P

@Jeffrey Larsen: I guess what I'm getting at is, that in everyday speech or even in correspondence, no one would call Theodosius "Count" in Latin, but eberyone knew he was a "Count". Or, am I wrong? I don't think anyone addressed him as "Your Grace", either. The title just seems not to fit the culture, particularly republican Rome, when peers called each other by their praenomen, and others by their names. But, that's what I want to know: had late Roman culture changed in this way, or did the older ways linger?

@Hume's Bastard: I believe by the time of Diocletian and especially afterwards the emperors began using increasingly less republican titles moving more towards medieval titles with which we are more familiar.

Diocletian for example discontinued the use of the title Princeps (or Augustus) in favor of the title Dominus (Lord).

So you mentioned that at this point Roman emperors began delegating military leadership to subordinates so that defeat could be blamed on the losing general  alone, so as to keep the emperor's position secure. However I seem to also remember one of the reasons Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy was so that an emperor could be in direct command of an army in the chief theaters of war at all times, to avoid a successful general going rogue and sending the empire into civil war. Why the sudden change?  Were the emperors really that secure that they thought they were above revolt?

By the way, excellent podcast.

I think by Diocletian, and especially after the emperors began to be used less and less Republican labels are moving more medieval titles, which are more familiar.

While the final "t" in the French expression "coup d'etat" is not pronounced, the "c" in "coup de grace" is. It makes the sound of an English "s," thus: Coo duh grahs.

What Mike said, Coo duh grah, is spelled "Coup de gras"-- in French, it means "blow of fat."

While we are nitpicking and talking about validity of history recommendations - I have one that is both:

Doris Kearns Goodwin's book "Team of Rivals" is a little on the sketchy side, IMHO.  She's a known plagiarist and has a clear current political bias that tends to color her interpretation of events.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts... I've kind of written her off (which may not be fair)... if y'all disagree - I'll give her another shot.  Like Doris herself said, “Why, simpleton, do you mix your verses with mine? What have you to do, foolish man, with writings that convict you of theft? Why do you attempt to associate foxes with lions, and make owls pass for eagles? Though you had one of Ladas's legs, you would not be able, blockhead, to run with the other leg of wood.”

...at least i think it was Doris.  ;)

I thought the plagiarist thing was a few missed citations from a work she had already footnoted extensively in one book.  Until she repeats it I just figured it was an error.  'Team of Rivals' is an excellent read IMO go ahead and check it out.  I am not sure what her current political bias is but she was certainly pro-Republican in that book...but it was a Lincoln book so yeah.

Mike, I sense you're pacing this so everything wraps up around episode 200. If that's the case, I'd love to see (or hear) a sort of "finale" episode where you offer your summary and observations on the entire Roman enterprise, rather than just ending upon Augustus Romulus' disappearance into obscurity.

This podcast has been a really fun ride and I'm happy to have been a listener for so long.

I'm obviously late to the pedantry here - but I just can't help myself.  I think that Mike misused the word "bemused" in describing the reaction of the citizenry to Procopius's coup.  "Bemused" means "stupefied", "utterly confused", "transfixed" - not something like "only mildly concerned or interested", which is I think what was intended.

I love how THOR has spawned so many other copycat podcasts.

"The History of"....  Russia, China, Japan, World War II.
People trying to copy THORs success.

With THOR of course having it's roots in "12 Byzantine Emperors" and things like "Napoleon 101".

And you can see that they are taking to same arc.  They start out a bit stiff and sounding like they are reading an essay, but gradually they loosen up and get comfortable.

It's cool to hear the entire journey of a historical story in this way.

With the fall of Rome now just 100 or so years off, I'm beginning to think of how it all ends.

I'm struck by how the empire post476 still thought of itself as Roman and given that the city was recaptured 60 years after it was lost, might you not consider carrying on to Justinian at least?

I have a suggestion I'd like to throw out there. Why not continue the podcast until March 24, 617 AD, which is Rome's half-millionth day. That would take us into the medieval transition period, the decay of the western reconquests, and the active reign of Heraclius. Most importatly, 500,000 is a nice big-round number! :)

Only 90 more years of Western Empire to go?  I am sad.

And I'm wondering where to go next.  I loved "Twelve Byzantine Emperors" (it's what led me to THoR), and have Lars' "The Norman Years" on deck.  But I feel like there's many centuries in between that I want to savor first!

Byzantium is covered. Anyone know a good podcast on the Muslim caliphates and kingdoms? Or the early medieval ages?

An "A History of The Dark Ages" podcast would be great by someone.  Frankish Kingdoms and so forth.

I know "History According to Bob" did a run on the Carolingian Franks, which was a bit heavy going to be honest.

"Europe from its Origins" was a rather wonderful attempt at describing life after the Romans.

Of course, THoR could just keep going....
The story gradually becomes more about Vandals and Ostrogoths and so forth, than the ever weakening Romans anyway.  You could plot a comfortable course into Theodoric the Great and onwards to Charlemagne.

But I guess the show has to end eventually.

As a self confessed imitator of THOR, I have to say that THOR is still the best. The last 2 episodes have been brilliant - Mike I don't know how you keep it going. Doesn't inspiration fail you every so often? I agree with everyone - keep going on the Eastern Empire, afterall they called themselves Romans. Or maybe the Holy Roman Empire?

Anyway, enough flattery. If we are in recommending mode, I have loved the 'Europe since it's orgins' podcast.

And on books I've read 2 Excellent ones recently - neither have anything to do with Rome. 'A Time Travellers Guide to Medieval England' by Ian Mortimer, and 'The English Civil War first hand' by Tristram Hunt. Both seriously good books.

I'm bummed that Julian did not have more time to manage his estate, and enact his policies--truly a fascinating and potentially great (influential) emperor.
Belatedly thought of a great read, available through Audible:  Gustave Flaubert's "Salambo".  Flaubert is one of the greatest writers of historical fiction, and "Salambo" gives a wonderful description of Carthage as it was vying for regional dominance with Rome.  Carthaginian distaste for fighting resulted in the hiring of mercenaries, and Flaubert gives a colorful account of the huge cultural variety of participants:  "Four great funeral piles were built for the men of Latin race, the Samnites, the Etruscans, the Campanians and the Bruttians.  The Greeks dug graves with their sword points.  The Spartans took off their red cloaks and with them shrouded their dead; the Athenians laid them out with their faces toward the rising sun; the Cantabrians buried them under a heap of pebbles; the Nasamones trussed them double with ox-hide thongs, and the Garamantes went down and interred them on the shore, so that they might for ever be washed by the waves.  The Latins mourned because they could not collect the ashes in urns; the Nomads sighed for the hot sands in which they mummified their dead, and the Celts for their three rough stones under a rainy sky at the end of some gulf of many islands."  The military and technological contributions of the different peoples are also admirably described.  Hamilcar, Hannibal's father, is the main character; Salambo is his daughter.

Did I miss something?  (I don't think so...)  At 15:27, you say, "Some sources point to carbon monoxide poisoning".  And then... nothing!  That's it!  Even if this freak accident was mythical, wouldn't it have been nice to have at least a sentence or two about it?  If I hadn't already known the story about the charcoal brazier in the tent, I would have been a little stumped.  Was Jovian sucking on the tailpipe of a taxicab?  Did the Greyhound bus from Ancyra to Nicaea pass by, leaving the emperor and his retinue in a cloud of fumes?  I mean, c'mon, that's one of the (slightly) juicier mysteries, and you swept right on past it!  But hey, look at it this way- at least you know I was listening, right?  I am that- an avid listener for sure.  Thanks, and keep up the good work!  (But when there's something unusual like suffocating emperors, hey- give us a little more color, man!)  :-)

Is it just me or does the script include a lot more swearing that it used to? I think most THOR fans understand what you're trying to say without needing any trite references to Hell.

Your recommendation of "1421" is a rare mistake on your part.  The book is WIDELY held to be pseudo-history built from misinterpreted data and even just flat out make-believe.  Honestly, it is no more accurate than a piece of bad historical fiction that only pays lip service to getting the history right.

Just check out Wikipedia and other similar sources and the criticism of "1421" they list. Mr. Menzies is another classic example of someone making a lot of money because he is a talented charlatan who got really lucky, not because he is a skilled historian who earned his success.

Otherwise, your latest episode is as great as ever!

There is one tragic/farcical account of Julian getting speared in the back by one of his own men as he led the attack against the Persians. Sadly, it was not the heroic 'death in battle' that a traditional Roman would have wished. In any case, it was a silly way to die in a pointless war. The Emperor Heraclius will eventually show Julian, Valerian, Mark Antony and Crassus how war with should have been conducted.

Ironically, the Emperor that Julian resembles most is Constantine, I think. Both men believed they had divine inspiration, wanted to overthrow the religion of the Empire and were determined to war with Persia. Both at some point may have believed they were reincarnations of Alexander. With a little more guile on the part of Julian and a little less on the part of Constantine, we may have been hearing about St Julian the Great and Constantine the Heretic in these podcasts.

First, I am glad to finally post a comment.  I have spent the last 8 months catching up on the podcast with only one disappointment and that is I hadn't started THOR sooner.  Now that I am current I am excited to finally join the conversation often referred to in the podcast. Second, I am sad, however, to discover today's conversation is about the audible pick. Seriously?  No disrespect to Alan Hoch, Founder, and Scott Scheule's perspective but their comments seem like a distraction to the podcast itself. Meanwhile, Mike, Mark, and Bertrand, cheers!

Bob, if you want people to take the podcast seriously it can't be endorsing pseudo-history by a proven charlatan.

It's the sort of mistake that can destroy a podcast's credibility -- if I didn't already know how great "The History of Rome" was and had heard this endorsement of "1421" at the start of my first taste of this podcast I'd probably would have turned it off right then and there.  It would be like listening to a biology podcast only for the first thing you hear to be the author endorsing some book on creationism!

It makes the presenter and the podcast look bad -- there are a number of podcasts out there that present themselves as "authorities" on a given subject only to really just be cranks trying to push pseudo-history and/or science. Give people a reason to think you are one of them and your podcast fails before it's begun!

Afer all, we don't want people mistaking "The History of Rome" as a home for crank history!

Matt:  But, people can easily THINK it says something about this podcast when it endorses a fraud.

Yes, "The History of Rome" is a great podcast that I've listened to for YEARS, but -- as I said -- if I had just started with this episode and heard a recommendation for such a well known travesty as the first matter of business I would have turned it off RIGHT THEN.  So may other people anyway.  If nothing else, it's really embarrassing!

I consider this important, so much so that next episode an apology/retraction should be given.  If listeners start to think that Mike believes in/endorses crank history then they may start to distrust anything he says on the podcast.  Just one dumb mistake can cost you years of good will...

And, remember, "1421" isn't just a piece of bad research or just a matter of opinion.  It is a complete fraud full of nonsense reasoning, made up facts, and crank history.  For a history podcast to endorse it amounts to an astronomy podcast endorsing a book on astrology!

I honestly think people are doing Mike a disservice to suggest he should just ignore this issue.  He can win a lot of good will by reputiating his recommendation -- and gain a lot of bad will if he were to act like the only problem is with those of us complaining.  For everyone who posts a comment there are going to be hundreds who feel the same way, but who don't bother.

@ Mark. Your Julian-Constantine comparison is interesting and apt, although neither emperor would be flattered by it. In some of his writings, Julian seems to follow Neoplatonism, a philosophy that has more in common with Christianity (ie. belief in a single infinite Source that gives life to all things) than with Polytheism. His frugality and rectitude resembles a Christian Acetic more than a pagan priest. However at other times, he seems to endorse Theurgy, the idea that religious rituals can shape the future.

I think one reason for his failure to galvanise paganism is that he tried to make it appear more 'Christian'- more unified across cities and provinces with charitable institutions, an established set of doctrines and an agreed hierarchy.

Definitely agreed, Alan. It's nonsense and should be dismissed as such until the author can actually prove any of his flat-out assertions. It also goes far beyond merely "maybe made it to the Americas". "Somewhat speculative" doesn't come close.

Zheng He is impressive, no doubt, but let's stick to the ones we actually know visited the Americas, like the natives, Norse and post-Columbians. Not write pure fiction based on "what-if" due to NOT having data about a specific point and then try to pass it off as hard historical fact......and then go on to give all the credit of the Renaissance to "Chinese sailors coming to Europe". Is there ANYTHING he thinks wasn't done by Chinese Sailors? Sheesh.

Why not just say that the Crisis of the Third Century was so poorly documented because all the Romans were chilling with the Cherokee at the time, if not having evidence means you're in the Americas.. ;)

I said nothing on the actual meat of the podcast because it had nothing objectionable. I commented only on the book pick, because it was the objectionable part of the podcast--and, though it doesn't please me to say it, it makes me suspicious of the podcast in general that its producer could recommend such schlock.

To create a history podcast, one must be able to distinguish between good and bad sources. The fact that the author would recommend such a poor book indicates he's unable to make those kind of distinctions, and thus draws the podcast itself into doubt.

There is a wealth of historical material in this great podcast to discuss and debate yet the discussion seems to be stuck on 1421, which was clearly acknowledged as "highly speculative". The podcast has covered its bases well and lost none of its credibility.

I, at least, learn most of the things I know about Roman history from this Podcast, Ies, so I don't have a tremendous amount of external commentary beyond pondering what Mike presents. This episode seems to-the-point enough that there's not much to interject with besides "Enjoyed it. :)". :)

Now of course there's all the stuff about speculative alternative history that naturally accompanies figures like Julian the Apostate and Blot-Sven (proclaimed king over Sweden, ruled the eastern half, and rejected Christianization before it was rooted in the country. He was killed by his dishonourable christian Brother-in-Law after they set fire to his house in the night and killed him when he escaped the flames. The Brother-in-Law had previously ruled both areas, but was run out when he demanded conversion and banned sacrifices and Blot-Sven was proclaimed King).

I'm under the impression that Christianity was on much firmer footing in the eastern half of the Empire (is that correct in general terms?), so it'd be interesting to see Julian live a long life and be partially successful (stemming the tide of Feudalism for the time being and stopping the march of Christianity in at least the western half). Probably would lead to a break between East and West earlier, though. Not that the natural progression had long to go by this point anyway.

Mike, don't feel bad about the 1421 thing. Yes, it is "pseudohistory", at best speculative and at worst a pile of crap. However, I found a link with the concept of "storytelling" and the many and speculative stories of Julian's demise. For many things you have told us about..the founding of Rome, the kings of Rome, even histories written by the ancient historians are flawed. Donald Kagen, eminent historian and Yale professor says that there are parts of history we can only speculate about.
1421 should be read (if at all) for what it is, an historical theory which when subjected to peer review, does not stand up. History, science and indeed life in general is littered with such trash. To discern the useful from the unhelpful it helps to know what they both look like.
I for one have read 1421 and found it full of holes.

oops! I meant to add that I'm currently reading (not via Audible, its a hardcover book) The Great Sea: A Human History Of The Mediterranean by David Abulafia. I am enthralled! This book sits nicely with THoR Podcast, tracing what is known of the Mediterranean and civilizations around it drawing on archeology, language and research. This will be one book I keep in my collection. It is a worthy rival to Gibbon and (in my humble opinion) in the same league as Donald Kagan's work. 5 Stars *****

This week's episode (i think it was this week) mentioned Ctesiphon.  I kept thinking to myself...why does that sound so familiar?  Then I remembered I took a "photo" of it the last time I flew over it in 2005.  I will try to post a Flickr link to it.

About the episode, rather than the forgotten recomendation, I get the feeling Mike has a soft spot for Julian. Are you a closet pagan?
I am back listening through old episodes and remembered a story about Pompey. As you know he had a remarkable career up until he forced himself into the "Holy of Holies" in Jerusalem, after this his victories quickly dried up, coincidence or the power of the monotheistic God? Interesting to speculate that if he had avoided this confrontation he may have succeeded in halting Caeser's rise to dictatorship.

I THINK Mike was making a joke with the "The history of the world in a 100 objects" The podcast was good and I'm sure the research was up to a good standard as it was a guy from the british museum doing it for the BBC. I havn't bought the book to go with the radio series/podcast so I don't know what's like but if it's like any other books the BBC put out with there shows then it's probably doesn't go into a hugh amount of depth, but usually good if you want to know the basics. So I would leave it as a joke, similar to that Rome Vs Rome one, but not as good.

@Sandy, I wouldn't speculate on any humans choice of gods however, if you go back to previous episodes you may find more evidence to support your belief ;)

I just want to say the thing about listener suggestions is Mike is busy. I also refer you to prior podcasts where he shares some of his personal business. I guess because of the most recent experience he'll have to do a little back checking before recommending.

I accept that we don't all hold similar knowledge and beliefs and therefore hope we can all hold fast to the gracious and grateful attitude of thankfulness to Mike for producing THoR.

Compilations of the book recommendations are listed for one which makes it easy to go search your local library:)

After being a THoR fan for so long, I was telling someone about it yesterday and realized it's been three years! I ony appreciate Mike more and the groups help us stay in touch and share our thoughts.

Thanks for the retraction and updated intro. Greatly appreciate your integrity for admitting you might have erred with 1421 (I did the same when I bought the book!). History of the World in 100 Objects is a great replacement.

Great podcasts by the way. I have yet to hear the Julian podcast (I am only up to Domitian. Keenly looking forward to the episode about Emperor Joachim Phoenix ;) - good to see Hollywood in ascendency after Kirk Douglas' stalled slave rebellion in 73BC)

I listen to 1421 about a year ago and thought it must be funded by Chinese propaganda.  It was pretty clear from the text that it is very speculative and full of unsupported conjectures.  I deeply discounted its historical value.

It is, however, a sign of the times that people are trying to raise the historical profile of China.  There will only be more revisionist history in this vein in the future.  1421 is pretty crude even for this genre.

I dont really fault Mike for passing along the recommendation someone else made. The prompt disclaimer neutralized any bad taste.

Thank you for the rich history lesson you put so much of your heart into.

I can't seem to get this particular episode to open properly; it seems to be missing.

Wishing you the best,

Vishnujana Dasa

Hi I was recommended this podcast by another one, and Being a big fan of Roman history, I'm quite exicted by this. unfortunately, this episode (146) dosen't appear to be in mp3 format it seems so I can't download it. Not sure if this is an error from the re-posting of the episode or something wrong with my browser. I'm not that dissapointed as I know a lot about Julian already plus I'm not a paying customer so I can't complain, but I would love to his this episode :)

Yeah, the intro was fabulous. :)

I must say that it seems quite unlikely that the main temple of interest in the area just "accidentally burned down from a lit candle" within days of the Emperor's kerfuffle. Seems more like Christian historians wanting to paint it as a purely one-sided conflict?

It'd also be worrying if anyone these days actually think an edict to get rid of oppressive discriminatory laws is actually "Infamous" on it's own merits, rather than what would come after it. If he actually was trying to make sure there was equal religious freedom then you'd have to be quite a scoundrel to say that's terrible. Even if he was trying to stir up conflict between different christian views (What, you have more of a right than they do just because you're the former Emperor's pet? I'd also wager today's Christians would not be getting along with that time's favoured version). Now when he starts explicitly banning the non-corrupt loyal Christians from jobs and positions in the administration then he's obviously wrong (not too unlike how Christians later would restrict the jobs Jews could have, which we certainly shouldn't look favourably upon).

It's also interesting how horrible and inhumane it is for Julian to reclaim non-Christian religious buildings from the desecration of the Christian rule at the expense of the citizenry now living there, but most wouldn't bat an eye when the conversation is regarding Constantine oppressing and forbidding and throwing out pagans on behalf of the Church.

Such transitions are quite jarring and I do like it when they're pointed out, like for example with the clip of you going "He did, after all, execute no more men than Dear Old Uncle Claudius" back in the day. They're sobering reminders to not get too biased about certain historical favourites. :)

Oh right. Forgot to mention: Mike, at the end you said "his far more mundane and worldly war with Persia", but Mundane = Worldly, so that's a bit odd to hear right after eachother (directly from Mundus, meaning world). Unless you used it as "banal", which I don't understand why it's even considered synonymous to in the first place. The world isn't. :)

This time of pulls and tugs between Christianity and Paganism, has a parallel in England after Henry VIII.  Mary being Catholic, Elizabeth being CofE... down to James II who tried to favour Catholicism again and had to flee the country for his troubles.

It must have been a tricky time for clergy to tiptoe through whatever was considered Politically Correct.  Being able to marry, then...  sorry, you're a wicked sinner again for having a wife and family.

I am finally caught up--having started with the first episode about four months ago. It's great listening while I am on the treadmill for an hour or while going for long walks. Now that I am caught up, I am going back to listen again to the Julius Caesar-Augustus-Claudius ones again, having just watched the BBC "I, Claudius" DVDs because of this podcast. Great mini-series BTW. The acting by all throughout was the best. (I especially enjoyed the scene where Caligula informs Claudius of his metamorphosis; Derek Jacobi is delicious from when he is told Caligula wants to see him--and wondering whether he's about to be killed--until the end of the scene where he pours the drink over his head. Too funny! Brilliant! Starts at the end of this video, at the time of 8:42: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1RbZQ_32kA&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1RbZQ_32kA&feature=related</a>   .

And ends at 5:25 of this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITuvkuYKz6I)">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITuvkuYKz6I)</a>

Haha. Love the dripping innocent-sounding sarcasm of "completely by.. surprise..!".

Also, it was pretty weird listening to this discussing the rich not paying any taxes at all after watching the Daily Show episode where they have the segment on Republicans in America compulsively referring to the Rich as "Job-Creators". Those unfortunate job-creating provincials, not getting away with bribing their way out of taxes anymore! It's an outrage, Julian! *Rolls eyes*

It is called the Laffer Curve people.  It worked two thousand years ago and it works today.  I laughed out loud when Mike said Julian the Apostate wanted to lower taxes to increase revenue.  Why don't the Democrats in the US today listen to Julian the Apostate.  I don't particularly care for his apostasy, but his economics are spot on! Mike Duncan should recommend the book: Soak the Rich, Lose the Rich by Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer.

I think the comparison to Marcus Aurelius was apt. Julian sounds like an interesting character.

Is anyone else really feeling like the Roman Empire, once it became Christian, wasn't really the Roman Empire they knew and loved anymore? Like something had been lost along with the pagan religion?

We are only a hundred years from then. Which could mean something in the order of 30 to 50 golden podcast more.

I have a question concerning this episode, what would "pagans" like Julian have referred to themselves as ?

I thought "pagan" was a somewhat derogatory term used by Christians, and would not have been used by the "pagans" themselves.  Is this true?  If so what Latin (or Greek as I believe that was the more common everyday language of the Empire at this point) would they have used to describe their religious beliefs ?

But seeing as Christianity and paganism existed side-by-side for centuries surely pagans would have had to have someway of describing their religion.

Particularly in Julian's day when it had  very much become a matter of Christians versus  "Everyone else".

Armchair psychologists love Julian because there is so much to work with: father, uncles and brother murdered by paranoid second cousin; childhood and youth spent in house arrest; domineering religious tutors (Christian and then polytheistic); reactionary religious and political influences under polytheistic tutors; constant threat of sudden violent and unexpected death; sudden rise in status, power and vulnerability; and forced into a job that killed predecessors. Note that he ascribes to Roman polytheism, which is the most incoherent, internally contradictory and superstitious of all existing belief systems, rather than stoicism, which was arguably more closely associated with Rome's greatness (ie. Cincinnatus, M. Aurelius) and more congruent with pre-Christian Roman ideals. There is more than a hint of passive rebelliousness - polytheism was more abhorrent to the Christian hierarchy than stoicism, which was seen as an enlightened philosophy. The comparison between Julian and M. Aurelius is weak. Nothing Julian wrote is comparable to the Meditations. Julian shows none of the insight, subtlety of thought or rhetorical skill that he should have acquired from his years at the feet of the masters of late antiquity. Compared with Caesar, Augustus, Marcus and Constantine, Julian's writings are embarrassingly adolescent and self-indulgent.

@ les. What is remarkable about Julian is that he did not turn into the monster he should have been. His brother Gallus had an identical family situation, while Commodus, Nero, Caligula and Caracalla had fewer obstacles and many more advantages and turned out far worse. While he may not have been an effective, high IQ emperor, like Augustus, Diocletian or Constantine, he came close to being a reasonably good one. He starts to unravel only when he begins evangelising for poltytheism and believing he is the reincarnation of Alexander. Enlightenment thinkers love Julian because he rejects Christianity. They tend to gloss over his fanatical polytheism.

@Ies: "Julian shows none of the insight, subtlety of thought or rhetorical skill that he should have acquired from his years at the feet of the masters of late antiquity. Compared with Caesar, Augustus, Marcus and Constantine, Julian's writings are embarrassingly adolescent and self-indulgent."

Rather than just take your word on that, do you have any sites where his surviving works are translated? I'd be very interested in taking a look into them myself. :)  Although I despise rhetoric, if considered an intellectual discipline, to my core as it is empty showmanship that disregards facts and merely try to trick others into agreeing with you, so him not applying that is a point in his favour, IMO. All of these "armchair" interpretations I've heard of him by Christians sound terribly defensive since, even if he personally wasn't good at expressing the ideas (which you'll hopefully give me the opportunity to see for myself), the points were still valid.

The contradictions are there, the incompatibilities with reality are there and the intolerance inherent in Monotheism had been on full display when they seized control. You're also exaggerating Roman Polytheism's relative amount of contradictions, since it's impossible for a religion that makes fewer paradoxical claims to be less believable (not to mention that people always have a blind-spot for their own religion. Thus why a Christian doesn't become a Muslim and vice-versa as a muslim/christian will know plenty of things wrong with the other's beliefs, but fail to see those same errors with his own faith).

Julian is interesting because of the absolute hopelessness of his quest to stamp out Christianity when it had already been established as a state religion.  Its like a modern-day ruler attempting to stamp out using the Internet or demanding that cars be banned in order to bring obesity levels back under control.

Like Julian, however, there is always an undercurrent in society that remembers the good ol' days (through rose coloured glasses of course).  Ever heard grandpa say "In my day things were different..."  I wonder just how many of the citizens of Julian's empire secretly shared his intoxication with paganism?  I wonder how many of his soldiers secretly sacrificed to the Roman pantheon or dreamed of the Fields of Elysium once they'd suffered a fatal injury in battle?

I guess we'll never know, but it sure would be interesting to know how the average solider or citizen felt about the imposition of Christianity upon his/her life before it became a cultural norm...

Carpe Diem!

I think Brad is right. Julian is more like the 'whip-smart' conservative kid of hippy parents than the hippy kid of conservative parents. With respect to the gods, Romans had always been good at hedging their bets and even Christians, or 'Gallileans' as Julian calls them, would probably have retained some pagan, or in Julian's words 'Greek', practices. Roman Catholics today still have saints which fulfil the role of some pagan deities and South American Christianity incorporates some preChristian beliefs.

@ Mainframe
<a href="http://www.thenagain.info/classes/sources/julian.html">http://www.thenagain.info/classes/sources/julian.html</a>
In his Letter to Arsacius, Julian as Pontifex Maximus (ironically the precursor to the Pope)bemoans the fact that pagan priests do not engage in more charity and sobriety (ie. do not behave more like their Christian counterparts). The style tries to emulate that of some of the Pauline Epistles but does not quite make it. He gives the religion he abhors the best advertisement.

<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_orations_01_constantius.htm">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/julian_apostate_orations_01_constantius.htm</a>
Here he flaunts his skill as an orator. Perhaps he learnt his rhetoric too well? He certainly likes to show it off.

<a href="http://www.attalus.org/translate/misopogon.html">http://www.attalus.org/translate/misopogon.html</a>
Julian tries his hand at Greek satire and complains that the people of Antioch do not like him.

He was certainly not an ignoramus or an idiot. I tend to forget he was only in his mid 20s at the time. To be fair, Ammianus can be just as  ponderous; so it may have been considered fashionable at the time. Also, Julian preferred to write in Greek while Marcus Aurelius and Caesar chose Latin, a language better suited for brevity and directness. Finally, Julian writes for a very specific and narrow audience - the highly erudite pagan - while Caesar wrote for anyone who could read.

I suppose another reason why we all find him fascinating is that he actually tells us what he thinks. In that way he is like Marcus Aurelius.

Long time listener, first time poster...I would really like a stop in the narrative to reflect on the changes on the ground again soon.   Technology, language, culture, etc. I get the impression that life in the empire for 95% of the people hasnt really changed since Augustus or before.  I am guessing this is largely true - there have been hints but I am really interested in how we are going to fade into the "Dark Ages".

Well, I am now up to date and will have to wait  for a new episode like millions of others. :(

And what a journey it has been!

I always wanted to read a complete history of Rome especially after watching BBC's I, Claudius and HBO's Rome, but I wanted to start chronologically and all the way back from Remus and Romulus. Mike Duncan began his series even earlier than that ("beginning with Aeneas's arrival in Italy") and that meant I had give this podcast at least a chance. The rest is history.

The only other talking book that I'd listened to prior to THOR was "Band of Brothers", which chronicled the feats of a company of airborne soldiers in WW2. I'd already had a dim view of podcasts and talking books in general, and the enjoyment I had with the Band of Brothers greatly diminished each time the narrator said the wounded were 'evacuated'. (According to a journo in HBO's The Wire: "You can't evacuate people. A building can be evacuated. To evacuate a person is to give that person an enema.")

So I was acutely sensitive to a possible 'evacuation of Romans', which, in my view, would be the only blemish on this truly historic podcast. Much to his credit, Mike did not use that word once and he'll be remembered for a thousand years for it.

 This is a great podcast, Im not up to this episode yet because I recently did a rewind, back to the beginning, The age of kings and "Youthful Indiscretions." I never paid any attention whatspever to early Rome until this podcast, but Duncan made it fascinating. Im probably not alone in knowing most of the story but listening to Duncan's storytelling anyway.
   I love how when I subscribed, it was still before the consulship of Julius and Caesar back when Mike Duncan didnt know how long hed be doing this. Im glad Audible stepped in to make the Podcast profitable, so now its gauranteed to end in 476AD. Although, if its making a couple grand a month Duncan will go all Edward Gibbon on us and take it to 1453.

@ Gareth - follow Mainframe's third link; it's fascinating. Julian calls his beliefs "the religion of the Greeks."

Our "favorite apostate" comes a bit like a nagging Puritan. His advice to the priests:

- No priest is anywhere to attend shameful theatrical shows or to have one performed at his own house;
- We must get rid of all offensive jokes and licentious associations;
- No priest is to read Archilochus or Hipponax or anyone else who writes poetry as they do;
- They should stay away from the same kind of stuff in Old Comedy;
- Exhort the priests neither to approach a theater nor to drink in a tavern.

Meanwhile, the "Galileans" have hostels for all travelers, care for the poor regardless of religion, practice kindness towards strangers, and care for their dead.  He notes that "there are no Jewish beggars" and that they are caring for the Roman poor as well.

I'm an atheist myself, but I think in the context of the era, Christianity sounds far better than paganism!

I'm really enjoying the discussion on this episode. Very intelligent offerings, spurring me on to read more. Thanks for the links.
I am also listening to a podcast from iTunes called "Europe From It's Origins" covering the time from AD312 - AD1095. There are 10 episodes. They were released in 2009. Joe Hogarty covers some of the same events but is not as fluent and easy listening as Mike. Some of the music and incidental sounds are a bit disturbing. There's more about the Christian/political machinations of the bishops etc. but still worth a listen as it can help tie the story threads together. Keep Listening!

If anyone is in England right now and fancies seeing some Roman archaeology then there is a fantastic excavation going on at Silchester near Reading <a href="http://www.silchester.rdg.ac.uk/field_school_index">http://www.silchester.rdg.ac.uk/field_school_index</a> its a great place to see some cool archaeology and a real life excavation. Also i have an audible recommendation Emperor: the gates of Rome by Conn Igguldon. A fictional account of the life of Ceaser. a really enjoyable book that has a great take on Ceasers life. remember its only fiction so im sure there are lots of inaccuracies

If you're looking for a book to recommend next (in case it hasn't already been recommended), then here's a perfect fit: "Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America" by Robert Charles Wilson.

Not only is the text very good, but it's a speculative fiction story about America after Peak Oil that is explicitly modelled on the story of Julian the Apostate.

The audio version is here: <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002V07ZWI&qid=1309791169&sr=1-1">http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002V07ZWI&qid=1309791169&sr=1-1</a>

Just wanted to offer a sincere thank you for this series - it is incredible.  I've listened to every episode and will continue to listen until 476CE - or if you choose to go to 1453CE with the Eastern Roman Empire's fall I'd be happy to go there too!

In any case, keep up the good work!  Your fans appreciate you!

Mike (and this may be a little late, as I'm listening to 141, but hopefully this is still relevant), I looked up "arian christianity" on wikipedia. I spelled it wrong. Before I looked it up, every time I heard the word "Arian" I would mentally misspell it as "Aryan". Naturally, this made me think of both the original speakers of Indo-European languages (my sister is a linguist-in-training) and, well, World War Two. Could you please clear this up for all the other people out there who are probably confusing this too? I think you mentioned the root of the whole conflict a while back, but it's been so long that I don't think I'm the only one making this mistake.

Gore Vidal's Julian was one of the few historical fictions I have read and up until now I have been uninterested in the late empire so I am really looking forward to see the accurate depiction of the Julian's reign. It is a fairly good book, but like I just said, I do get the feeling its historical value isn't great.

Gore Vidal's Julian was a pretty good read, but not as gripping as I hoped. His Julian seems a lot more rational, introspective and self-critical and is a much better writer than the real one, who appears superstitious, fanatical and a bit mentally unhinged. Vidal relies heavily and uncritically on Ammianus Marcellinus who idolised Julian. As someone else pointed out a few weeks ago, the trend nowadays is to romanticise Julian and vilify Constantine. Compared with Constantine, Julian's successes (eg Strasbourg)were few and his gaffes (eg. Imperial Army trapped 100 miles inside Sassanid territory) were major. I hope Mike can explain why everyone is so fascinated by Julian.

I went a bought 10 Roman coins off eBay.
Not expensive, but then the coins aren't very valuable or good quality.  But I wanted to touch something Roman after living so long with this Podcast.

So the first coin I tried to Google and figure out turned out to be for Constantine II.  Cool!  A coin from the events we're listening to now!  The son who controlled the West, picked a fight with Constans, and got himself killed good and early.

On the back of the coin is apparently says "The Glory of the Army".  So it's pretty obvious where his priorities lay.

But the odd thing is that the coin was supposed to be minted in Constantinople.  For use in France and Spain at a time when the various bits of the Empire were not being very co-operative?

Anyway, I'm waffling.  As always, love the podcast.  Only a hundred and ten years to go....

Love this podcast. Really is the highlight of my listening week. Don't know if Mike is familiar with the BBC kids TV programme Horrible Histories which seeks to engage children with history through comedy sketches and musical numbers  that focus on such youthful concerns as um ...poo and death, but this number on Rome's worst emperors (a pastiche of MJs B.A.D.) made me laugh.

I didn't like the Silver Pigs either and so never got around to any other of the Falco series. Either as crime or historial fiction, it failed to be credible.

I read The Silver Pigs and thought it was a light, fun read. I couldn't get through the second one in the series though so I've given up on Falco for now.

I will second the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor; they're very good for the most part, though they do fall off a bit in quality towards the end. I've reviewed a bunch of them here.

I would interested to hear what anyone else thinks of Edward Gibbon and The Decline and Fall. What exactly were the Romans declining from and why did it take 1200 years? There seems to have been corruption, civil war and carnage at all stages of the Empire and even the Republic as well. Also, he tries too hard to inject hyperbole and other rhetorical devices in every one of his sentences.

About 5 months ago I got into this podcast, and am trying to catch up. I'm at Episode 60. (I expect it will take me until the end of the year to catch up.) But I wanted to say at this point that I am enjoying this series very much. I didn't know that I could be so captivated by this time-consuming (but wonderfully so) history of ancient Rome.  Thank you. Well done!

And Mike, I will be in Europe in late May to early June. Great time for another tour, don't you think?

One suggestion (and likewise wish) would be the creation of a number of standalone podcasts dealing with various topics in Roman society, economy, culture, military, technology, etc, which don't necessarily fit into the standard chronological podcast format but which nevertheless podcast listeners could refer to and listen to whenever they want. Such a series of lectures would add further value to an already outstanding series...

Mike, glad to have you back and I don't think you should beat yourself up about the Saul Tigh quote, because I too just got into the BSG reboot and also have a memory of that quote from the show. There's no way for me to conflate anything because I've never seen HBO's Rome. I'm not absolutely sure it was Tigh, but he's the most likely character that would have said it. It's gonna bother me until I find it, so I'll get back to you on the exact episode number, but I'm pretty sure I'm right about the quote and as such, so are you.

Dear Mike,

My second comment so far.

I am currently at episode 109 and going through 3 to 5 eps a week. I wish I could slow down the rate so I won't catch up with the rest of you until later:) The down side to that is I am not able to ask question while the topic is fresh.

But this I have to ask before Goths start invading the empire in the next few episodes on my calender:

What was the climate like in Europe during the Roman expansion and retreat? Is there sufficient anecdotal evidence in ancient writings that might suggest climate was as warm if not warmer than now?

I am talking about the so-called Roman Warm Period, of course, which is a bit of a touchy subject for some people (Wikipedia won't even allow a page on it apparently because it is not considered as scientifically certain as Medieval Warm Period).

Each time I hear about one Emperor or another campaigning along the Northern frontier, I wonder how the climate was like then.

Well, Mike, how was the climate like in Roman times, especially in the North? Is there any historical anecdotal evidence to support the claim that Rome was invaded from the North by tribes running away from cold temperatures?

Kind Regards

I am also looking forward to the mention in the podcast of the city I was born and grew up in: Diyarbekir (Amida) on the Tigris.

I think it already got a mention in Episode 105 as one of those places taken from the Sassanids during Alexander Severinus's reign.

But the town (village, perhaps) had already been taken by Romans as far back as 66 BC, during the Third Mithridatic War.

From where I grew up Rome was a far, far away western city that couldn't possibly have anything to do with me.

It never occurred to me that my place of birth was conquered by the Romans even before Britain and Gaul.

But there is more. The city's iconic walls was built by Constantin II. It is still standing and it still looks imposing. It's a pity I never appreciated its historic value when we were little kids playing hide and seek in its shadows.

I went to bed last night listening to Episode 109, and there Mike unexpectedly talks about the Goths and adds climate change as one of the reasons the Goths may have come down South on Romans.

Oh, well, maybe I ought to have waited just a day longer before asking the question:)

Wow, the dark stone of the walls of Diyarbak must have been one of the most unusual and beautiful in the empire. Amazing to have the childhood memories and being blissfully unaware of the significance of what was essentially your playground. The walls are well preserved. May that be because of the climate? Or has it served the community to maintain them? Thankyou for sharing.

Hi Louise

The wall was built of black basalt, which is common in the area near an extinct volcano. All historic buildings in Diyarbekir (Amida) carries that signature look.

The wall was instrumental in winning a military conflict as late as 1925, when besieging Kurdish rebels failed to take the city quickly. Kurds consider it as their capital city and would very much like to change the name to 'Amed'.

City residents take immense pride in the walls, some calling it the 'Castle'. A few of the 82 round towers (many of which were added to the wall over the centuries) have their own individual history and mythology among the locals.

From the pictures it looks as though much restoration and preservation work has gone in to the wall. It certainly looks better than I last saw it more than two decades ago.

Hi sHx
Ahh black basalt! I understand now. Where I live was once an active volcanic area. There are basalt outcrops along the north west coastline of Tasmania. Inland, the soils are distinctive red/brown as well, a byproduct of weathering, good for growing vegetables!
Hope to one day visit Diyarbekir to see the walls myself. Until you posted about this place I knew nothing of it. Thankyou for sharing.

The title notwithstanding, this was a very hard-edged episode without the theological dross. I liked the notion, that Constantine, sadistic statesman par excellence, feared the wrath of the deity he so used for his own aggrandizement. With an eye on the end game and the medieval period to come, Duncan's argument, that it was Constantine's heirs who spoiled Constantine's legacy, seems a bit too easy on Constantine.

I think Mike's assessment of Constantine was balanced pretty well. Gibbon, on the other hand, is a bit narrow-minded and bigotted. It wasn't a bad decision to settle Germans into depopulated parts of the Empire and the army. It might have been the only way the Empire was going to survive the serious lack of manpower. The Germans who settled during Constantine's reign should probably be distinguished from the Germans and Goths who settled and rebelled during the much later reigns of Valens and subsequent emperors.

How many times in previous episodes have we heard about Rhine and Danube legions rebelling under a usurper? Also, the potential barbarian invaders in the 4 and 5th centuries seem too numerous, determined and united for the standard frontier legions of the first and second centuries to whip. Centralising the Imperial Army would seem the sensible solution.

As for the succession problem, no other Roman Emperor seems to have solved it either. While it is fair to criticise Constantine for killing Crispus, it would also be fair to criticise Marcus Aurelius for not killing Commodus and Septimius Severus for not committing the double infanticide of Geta and Caracalla.

I am not sure why Gibbon blames Christianity for the fall of the Empire. According to his own gigantic work, the decline really becomes obvious with the pagan Commodus and accelerates during reigns of the pagan emperors of the third century. Also, the Eastern (Christian) Empire outlives the Western one by 1000 years.

Mike, would it possible to do a rough outline of the roman worldview that is about to be replaced by Christianity? What I mean by this is that we all know what the Christian worldview is regarding how old the world is, where humans came from and how the world was meant to end. Yet I cannot for the life of me find anything about what the Romans thought about these questions pre-Christianity.

Obviously Rome had many cults and maybe they had differing answers, but surely there was a broad cultural consensus, just like the belief in multiple gods.

So,

- how old did they think the world was?

- was time viewed as cyclical or linear?

- where were humans thought to come from?

- how was the world meant to end?


If anyone else knows anything about this let me know. I want to get a fuller sense of what is about to be replaced by the Christian outlook.

(btw, I'm currently writing this from a cafe in Diocletian's Palace)

Cheers

Great episode.  This is my first time commenting, but I've been following the series for a little while filling in the huge holes in my ancient Rome knowledge (which would be everything except Romulus, Caesar, most of the people who show up in "I, Claudius", the year of the four emperors guys, Constantine and bits and pieces otherwise.)  Thanks for running this thing for so long.  I almost feel bad for saying this, but I'm looking forward to the chaos that's probably coming after Constantine checks out.

@Ben. Great questions. It seems they, like the Greeks, believed time was linear - ie. it had a beginning and will have an end. Stoics believed the Universe was created from something called 'Mind'. Although Mind has deistic qualities, Mind itself was composed of matter. Humans were created from Mind. Epicureans (eg. Lucretius) believed the Universe and everything in it (ie humans) resulted from a conflux of atoms. This has no theistic or deistic characteristics. Ovid's Metamophoses recounts a few creation myths about the Universe which are probably just poetic counterparts to the Stoic and Epicurean beliefs.

I think the cynics were an exception, believing the Earth, stars, Sun and humans had always been there and will always be there.

I can't tell you how any of them thought the world was going to end.

@Mark: OK, god points on succession. But, Diocletian had indicated a way to avoid messy succession crises, institutionalization of redundant organizations. It was Constantine who undid Diocletian's reform. In that sense he's a throwback to Octavian and M. Anthony.

@Hume's bastard. What I find amazing about Diocletian's Tetrarchy is that it actually worked
All prior power sharing attempts had failed i.e. 1st& 2nd Triumvirates and Gallic-Palmyrene-Roman Empires.

@Mark. Unlike Augustus and Aurelian, Constantine did not groom a worthy surviving heir.

@Hume's bastard and Lesceau. All true about Constantine. I think, though, there has been a trend in modern times to vilify Constantine while legitimising Diocletian, romanticising Julian and deifying Augustus. In terms of the top ten Emperors of all time, Constantine seems to be at the very least as good as Augustus and better than Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus. In terms of the ten most influential people in all of history, he surpasses them all.

I'd like to share this link with Mike and THoR fans. The chap doing the history sculpture is "Greg Duncan". (Could it be a relative??) This history/sculpture presentation is vastly different to THoR podcast, subject, time and place but it also tells a story. I can thoroughly recommend seeing it as it took my breath away! The work is done in rare Huon Pine, which has a distinct and pleasant aroma. As so much sculpture was done in Roman times, and some survives for us to see, I thought you would all understand the link.

here it is...

When Constantinople was officially dedicated in 330AD it was know as Nova Roma (New Rome). The city was unofficially known as the "City of Constantine" (Constantinopolis in latin) shortly after. Under the reign of Theodosius II the city officially became known by the honorific eponym of Constantinople.

Great podcast!

I would love to know what significance the City of Rome has at this point. It seems to be stripped of political, economic, religious and military significance.

It makes me wonder why the sacking of Rome will mark end of the Empire when the City has so little influence.

I like Mike's teaser for the next episode
".... and finally on his death bed Constantine will be baptised."

Constantine dies in 337CE. The Roman church created an entire mythology around a supposed baptism of Constantine in 314CE by Pope Sylvester, who was said to have cured him from leprosy (which he never had). This also tied in with the fraudulent "Donation of Constantine", whereby the Emperor was supposed to have given dominion over the City of Rome to the Pope. There are paintings and frescoes in churches around the city showing these imagined events.

I hope people will forgive a spoiler if I say that he was finally baptised by an Arian priest (ironic really, after the Council of Nicaea). "Last minute deathbed baptism" was also an idea held by a different heretical sect who believed that once you were baptised there was no further forgiveness of sins (one shot deal!), and so they left it late so as to not risk messing up. It was a hangover from the novationist schism about re-baptism of apostates who denied christianity to survive the persecutions of Decius.
Strange that the man who presided over the Council of Nicaea should indulge in 2 heresies when he finally gets baptised.

After his death he was deified by the Senate to become Divine Constantine. I believe he was the last emperor to be deified.

Now a point of pedantry : Constantine is only considered a saint in the orthodox( eastern) church, and not in Roman Catholicism, which has 3 or 4 "Saint Constantine"s, none of which are this one.

Also his epithet "the Great" was added later by christian hagiographers, although he probably deserves it objectively, but for his ability to hold the empire together through 2 civil wars and to totally incorporate the christian religion into the fabric of the empire, thus allowing the empire to exert influence over religion in the way it always had with the old pagan gods.


And just for interest (I hope) - the word pagan was not in use at this time in a religious sense. "Paganus" in latin means the inhabitant of a small country village. After Theodosius outlawed the old religions at the end of C4th only the rural folk were able to cling to their old "pagan" beliefs due to being away from the controls present in the major cities.


As ever, Mike does a really fantastic job with a complex and difficult subject - although I'm inclined to be a little more cynical about Constantine's motives for sponsoring christianity so fully. I see it as more political, since by this stage the old gods were more like cultural traditions and the newer montheistic cults of Mithras and Sol Invictus were either too exclusive or didn't motivate the people like christianity did. Christianity was obviously not going to go away, so it was better to have them "inside the tent" as it were.

Of course only Constantine knows what he really believed - perhaps I'm a harsh judge!

This is the best podcast I've listened to, ranking right up there with the likes of Quirks and Quarks, Hardcore History, *anything* put out by the various universities doing course podcasts, TEDTalks, Historyzine, Binge Thinking...

You have won the internet, sir.

Does anyone know precisely when the city founded by Constantine began to be called 'Constantinople'? The name sounds Greek. The Latin for City of Constantine would be something like Urbs Constantini.

@miguel
There is a facebook group "The History of Rome podcast listeners" - search for it on facebook.


@Mark - to my knowledge it was commonly refered to as Constantinopolis from roughly the time of his death, even though it seems he wanted it called "Nova Roma".

Also the "Byzantine Empire" was never called that, but from 1600s onwards (to my knowledge) European historians called it that.
The Bizantines referred to themselves as the Roman Empire up to the end (1453), while everyone else called them "the Greeks".

This is my understanding of the names used at various periods in history - I'd be interested if anyone could confirm or deny the above.

@Mark  -  just for further interest....

The final name of Nova Roma/Constantinopolis/Byzantium is Istambul. This simply means "in the city"  - a follow-on from the habit of refering to Constantinopolis as simply "The City" during the Byzantine Empire.

Strangely Istambul was even in use in Turkish as a name for "The City" even before 1453, but on official documents and coins it is called by the Turkish variant  "Kostantiniyye" up until the 1700s.

Hi.  As always its a delight to listen to the History of Rome.  Many a car journey has flown past listening to this.

After this, it may come across as churlish to point out the tiny error that Trier is not on the Rhine but on the Moselle (which does flow into the Rhine at Confluentes/Coblenz).

@Mark
The name of the city stayed Constantinople officially until 1930 when the Ataturk government changed it. Maps and documents from before then referred to it by that name and the Europeans were not quick to take to the new name.
The term Byzantine, as I understand things, was used for the first time by German Renaissance scholars who wanted to make a distinction between the old Roman Empire and its surviving form in the East. There was more than a simple difference to keep things easy going on there.
When this change in nomenclature was made, the Turkish conquest of the shrunken remains of the Eastern Empire - reduced to a rump state by the combination of long years of misrule and political folly and the predatory Fourth Crusade - was about a hundred years old and the European West had no fond memories of the society that it had looted and helped destroy. Part of the idea was to paint the Eastern Empire as a decadent shadow of the "true" Rome, which means that they were a bunch of sneaky heretics who deserved what they got.

You took the words out of my mouth five weeks earlier. :)

@RomeStu

Well, I did my early schooling in Istanbul, among other places in Turkey, and I can tell you that history textbooks describe 'that empire' as Byzantine Empire (Bizans Imparatorlugu).

I strongly suspect however that 'Roman Empire' was how the Ottomans originally called their mortal enemies and that the switch to 'Byzantines' occurred in the 20th Century as the new Turkey sought to adapt the way westerners did things.

In Turkey, the word 'Rum' (presumably derived from Roman) is sometimes used interchangeably with 'Yunan' (Greek), but there is one community that Turks still insist on calling nothing but 'Rum': the Greek Cypriots.

Also, in addition to those who have already replied, the name Istanbul is derived from Constantinople and it has absolutely no other meaning in Turkish. The city was officially called Stambol and later Istambol while it was in the Ottoman hands.

re: Constantinople/Istanbul

Approx 2 hours ago, at the neighbour's place, I met a Greek chap who happened to be a bit of a history buff.

The talk inevitably came to the original name for Istanbul and he confirmed precisely what you had said (actually, he said 'istamboli' meant 'to the city', not 'in the city').

He also added that many of his fellow Greeks didn't know that little fact and that he would often cop flak for calling the city with its 'Turkish' name, instead of Constantinople.

Apologies for the earlier confusion.

Grew up with the Romans having been born a stone's throw from Antonine's Wall. The emprire's limit. Now living near York, Constantine's first capital.

the detailed story of the Arian controversy and Constantine's role in it is in the book "when Jesus became God" by Richard E.

Nice try. Not quite up to your usual impeccably high standards, though. In the first place, it's pronounced "a - THAN - a - sius", not "a - NA - tha - sius" (emphasis to draw attention to the correction, not as an indication of stress) - though I have to admit having made many similar blunders in pronunciation due to textual transpositions as I learned facts from reading (as I assume you have done here) rather than from listening.

More importantly, what was at stake in the Arian controversy was rather more significant than the outside observer might see - which is why so many outside observers tend to trivialize this pivotal controversy. I remember my university history professor reducing the whole conflict to an argument over a single iota: homoousios (of the same essence) vs. homoiousios (of similar essence). You (as usual) do better than most, but don't quite get (as, admittedly, Constntine himself might not have gotten) the full significance of full difference between Jesus being God Himself (of one essence with the Father) and being just a sort of divine first-created being (of like essence).

Even beyond the important theological distinction, though, what was at stake here was how Christianity was going to react to becoming the religion of the empire. Was it going to do so by accommodating its beliefs and teachings to what was most palatable to the Greeks and Romans who were used to an utterly transcendent prime-mover (the main reason that Arius was so allergic to the idea that Jesus was God Himself made flesh), or was it going to figure out how to articulate, in Greek philosophical language, the much less palatable Jewish idea of a God intimately involved with His creation?

I admit, however, that this is a tough assignment for any secular historian to take on - and I can see you are doing your best, which, as usual, is far better than most! Keep up the good work. I LOVE THoR (the podcast, that is, not the Norse god, so much), and look forward every week (or so) to the next episode's release. Hope you are having a great time touring the Old Country. Wish I could have come!

Great reference to Asimov :).
It's Fantasy and Sci-fi (Mostly Asimov's Foundation, everything by Terry Pratchett & George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire) that got me hooked on history and mythology in the first place.
This podcast is my real introduction to Rome, easy to understand and an enjoyable listen, great work :).

@FrJustin Thanks for fleshing out the theology behind this controversy. As I understand your comment the pivotal historical significance of this theological disagreement is that it was the line in the sand between a pagan monotheism which had been taking over the empire at a slow creep since Aurelian, and the JudeoChristian version of monotheism we are familiar with today.
@Ken Meece. Thanks for the book recommendation I am now very curious to know more about this.

Hi Mike,

Not sure if this has been brought up (ah, who am I kidding, it probably has) - now that you're only one and a half centuries from the deposition of Romulus Augustulus, are you going to end the podcast there? Byzantine history is fascinating, and I think you'd be great at it. Or, barring that, do you have any other projects in mind beyond THoR?

Audiobook recommendation: George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. It's a fantastic series and Roy Dotrice does a great job at reading the books, imo.

Mike - thanks again - great show!

All of my readings (and now listenings) regarding Constantine always begs me to question how the man isn't clearly one of the top 10 most important individuals in human history.  Not only did he legitimize an eastern religion (which became the foundation and justification for European dominance over the past 6 centuries), he literally, conquered the whole empire (what? 2 times over?). He modernized the military to herald and embrace middle ages military might.  He built a city that lasted for 1000 years, that served as the capital of Christendom for most of its life.  So much was the lore of Constantinople, that the Turks purposely capped their conquest when they toppled it.  Let alone that he commanded full control over a territory that was deemed too much for one man, and by and large would never be under one unified gov't again.  Quite an impressive resume.

He did mention something about what he had in mind after THOR which he thought will never happen and that is in the 100th episode.
Well as for when it ends and the Byzantine era and the end! Well......... can I answer that bit for you after it ends.

So...I just gone through the entire History of Rome podcast during the last couple of weeks, and now I don't know what to do. Am I seriously supposed to sit around doing nothing for a week waiting for the next show to be posted? Is there help out there for me? An "Anonymous-HistoryofRomeics" or something of that nature?

Jokes aside, great podcast, can't wait to get to hear more. And I don't know what Mike plans to do after THR but he sure found a winning formula

Yee-hah!  I started THoR about six or seven months ago, and as of today I am all caught up and for the first time will have to wait for the next episode.  It's nice to be on the same page as the rest of the class finally!

@ Mike - I've also really appreciated your coverage of the past couple centuries.  My basic knowledge of the history of the empire was: Augustine, great! Caligula, bad! Nero, bad! mumble mumble mumble Trajan Hadrian Marcus Aurelius great! mumble mumble mumble throw the Christians to the lions mumble mumble mumble watch out for the Germans and Persians mumble mumble mumble Constantine!

It's nice to have all the blanks filled in.

I can't believe we are over 130 episodes....of a podcast......a history podcast.....researched/written/recorded/edited by a single person. Truly a mindblowing endeavour.

Great episode as ever Mike.

Sorry to be really pedantic, but you said that Constantine's Basilica of Saint Peter was built over the site where Peter was crucified.

Close (about 50 yards probably), but not quite accurate. After his death in Nero's circus Peter was then buried in the nearby necropolis on the vaticanus ridge. This was then filled in and levelled off in around 320CE to create a platform on which to build the basilica. The high altar is  directly over the supposed tomb of Peter.

The church might overlap slightly with the circus, but it was the location of the tomb which was important, as with the Constantinian Basilica of St Paul on the Via Ostiense, built on the necropolis where Paul was buried, rather than the site of his martyrdom.

Also, the obelisk from Nero's circus was moved a short distance to its current position in front of St Peters in the late 1500s, giving rise to the misunderstanding that it was the site of the circus itself.


It's a small thing, and I hate to nitpick - your research and presentation are fantastic.

Dpn't worry, Mike, I'd wait the entire six weeks for the next episode - even if I WILL miss this next week.

Thanks for clearing up a little about how Constantine and the Church got along.

One question: in the 4th Century have the Romans become any more comfortable with sailing than they were in earlier times? What's the state of the art in naval technology in Constantine's time?

Bon Voyage!

Thank you very much, Mike, for planning to keep the podcasts coming while you are on your grand tour of the Roman world! Those of us not lucky enough to accompany you can at least keep listening to THoR while you are away.

Just one question for when you get back: Was the execution of Licinius the Younger related to the execution of his father or to some other high profile executions that are about to happen before long. In his three volume history of Byzantium, John Julius Norwich seems to think it was the latter.

Fantastic series, I've listened and listened to all of the episode so far. On my second run through!

One general question:  if republicanism fell because the empire needed a strong man at the centre to stop all the civil wars, why was republicanism not thought of again when the drive to become augustus created similar types of civil wars?

@Alexteacher, I doubt Mike's just going to randomly pick a civilization and start a podcast on it. He wants to do American history because he's interested in it and knows a lot about it -- which are two of the main reasons that THoR is so good. That said, American history doesn't interest me much, so as long as we're suggesting random historical epochs, I'll take the ancient Near East :)

It may or may not interest you fellow THOR folks to know that I just found a Roman coin... right here in coastal GEORGIA!

Story here:

<a href="http://forums.collectors.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid=815372">http://forums.collectors.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid=815372</a>

And I didn't even have my metal detector with me.  It was lying on top of the ground where it had been washed out of a sand roadbed.  It was on a colonial site, so chances are, it was lost sometime between the 1750s and the Civil War.  How it got there, I haven't a clue.  I'm a former coin dealer and an avid collector of Roman coins, so I know it is genuine (though not worth very much, monetarily).  It appears to be from the reign of Arcadius (383-408 AD; probably struck sometime in the 390s).

Cool, huh?  I know we haven't gotten to Arcadius, yet, but I wanted to share this amazing (and bizarre) recent find of mine.

I'm looking forward to a possible American History Podcast that was mentioned early on in this series. I know very little about it and Mike would be the best to tell me about it, judging by how much I've learned from him already. Yes, it will be sad to end this series, but one end is another beginning.
Hope all is going well on the tours. Am with you in spirit. Have been looking through my photos of my visits to Rome, Pompeii and Istanbul back in 1986 and 2004. I will go again one day.

Mike – how about this spontaneous advert for ThoR?

I've been a fan since I stumbled across this podcast over 2 years ago.  Last night I went to a public lecture about Liverpool's history, one of the Lightnight events in the UK.  Towards the end the speaker mentioned that the design of the city's Central Library was based on the Pantheon in Rome.

'Does anyone know who designed the Pantheon?' he asked.

'Hadrian,' I called out. He agreed this was correct, but looked surprised.

'The History of Rome podcast,' I responded loudly!

I love this podcast, definitely my favourite. Would have loved to go on one of the tours but the current crop are at bad dates for me. I still mourn the day I finally got up to date with these podcasts, and then had to wait every week for another.

Question for other listeners - do any of you know of a good blog about Rome? I got a Kindle and would quite like to do some light reading, with the kind of thing in the History of Rome podcasts. At the moment I am reading one of Adrian Goldsworthy's excellent books, but something in a blog format would be good too. Any suggestions?

It was a bit jarring to hear Church history, but I understand why Duncan included the section on the Donatists and the Council of Arles. And, it got me thinking about how the narrative has not only gone from tetrarchy to dyarchy, but it also seems Rome is more of a theocracy now. So, I ask, are Constantine's actions during the Donatist controversy different from how emperors generally acted in regard to the imperial cult?

I also read about Popes Miltiades and Sylvester I, who led during the time of Constantine. Just how did Constantine interact with these leaders?

I'm a bit confused by the bit where you went "And of course the child would be a boy"/"Gave birth to a son. Of course it was a son!". Is that noting an unfounded certainty on the behalf of Constantine (The odds are pretty good, but it's hardly a sure thing. Especially with infant mortality.) or is it simply noting that he would eventually wind up with several sons?

You also seem to be keeping it objective on Christianity so far, which I am very grateful for. Please, by Odin's beard, don't treat Christianity any different in future podcasts than you would the Roman Pantheon or Omens, since you're not disrespectful (shouldn't unnecessarily antagonize Christian listeners if it doesn't have a place in the narrative, after all), but not afraid to have fun with it. Just telling the truth is probably going to offend some Christians as most are very ignorant (in the literal sense, not as the insult) about the history of their religion, such as the councils where the high clergy vote on the divinity of Jesus and so forth.

Things like Lars Brownworth's take on heresies also make me go "..Wait what?" since he actually said "In the first century heresies could usually be cleared up by those who actually remembered Jesus, but as these people died off--". Now that presumes Jesus as an historical person, which there is very poor evidence for and certainly nothing that could validate anything miraculous, and that the cause for the later heresies weren't something as basic as "more Christians over a wider area lacking good communication with different cultural backgrounds and opinions, without any centralized authority on Canon".

Just treating Christianity as true and "Obviously Constantine -is- Great. Says so on his name!" attitudes are probably a big part of what has made me actually dislike him as both an Emperor and a person. :)

P.S. On the "Jesus as a real person": Obviously there were people around with the names attributed to him (as there still are), but that's not what defines a person. If we found out that Hernán Cortés was a lumberjack from Valdetorres then having a historical account for that person couldn't possibly show the truth of anything Conquistador-related. Also sorry for the long post, I just believe it's important for the quality of the PodCast. <3

@ Dave

Crucifixion was a standard punishment for vile crime (ie treason) to act as a deterrent to others.
The Romans used it most famously after Spartacus' slave/gladiator revolt in 73BCE where sources tell of 6000 slaves crucified along the length of the Via Appia.

My understanding is that it was outlawed by Constantine, probably as a political sop to the newly legalised Christians, but it had been in use around the mediterranean for about 1000 years, and was not invented by the Romans. I do not know how common it was in the 3rd/4th century - does nayone have any info.

check out this site for more details
<a href="http://www.joezias.com/CrucifixionAntiquity.html">http://www.joezias.com/CrucifixionAntiquity.html</a>



@mainframe
I too am pleased by the neutral tone of Mike's podcasts in relation to the history of Christianity as it becomes legal and dominant.

My take on Constantine is that he was a consummate politician who realised that christianity was not going away and so decided better to have it "in the tent" and control it than outside the tent being difficult. Obviously from the 4th century onwards all sources are slanted with a christian perspective, and many will have been wilfully "updated" by medieval monks to perpetuate their position. A good example of this is the so-called "Donation of Constantine" which supposedly had the Emperor giving the city of Rome to Pope Silvester, and thus formed the basis for the temporal power of the papacy in the middle ages. By the 1400s it was shown to be a 7th century fake!!!

Anyway, the next period in Roman history is going to be fascinating ...

Great job Mike - keep it up.

Another fantastic podcast, Mike! You make a very complicated time in Roman history engaging and understandable. With regards to Constantine's and Crispus' 'legitimacy', legitimacy in the pre-Christian Roman world was determined exclusively by recognition by the father, the 'Pater familias', not by whether the child was conceived or born in wedlock.ie. If and only if the father recognised the child as his child, then that child was legitimate, irrespective of his or her birth. There is no evidence that either Constantine or Crispus was considered illegitimate during their lives. Crispus' 'illegitimacy' might have been a retrojection following his death and 'damnatio memoriae'.

@mainframe Actually, most if not all credible historians - atheist, theist and agnostic - accept that Jesus ('Yeshua')was an historical person, whose life has been reinterpreted in the Christian Gospels. My Christian (and atheist) friends are less offended by the truth than by misinformation.

@Stuart I don't think Constantine was just paying lip service to Christianity, even though a sizable proportion, if not majority, of his army and subjects was probably Christian. His mother, after all, was a devoted Christian, towards the end of his life he assumes the title of 'Equal of the Apostles'('Isapostolos'),orders his sarcophagus erected in a Byzantine cathedral with 6 Disciples on either side and has himself baptised as a Christian on his deathbed. As Mike says, he was a man with a 'divine' mission.

@Bertrand:
Only if "credible" in this context means "people who already agree with me". Have a look at the actual evidence - there isn't really any of it. Or are you saying that he was simply one of a multitude of itinerant preachers and happened to be named Yeshua? The books of the new testament are not contemporary and even if they were they have an obvious bias and are unreliable in the extreme (They all disagree with eachother, and themselves). There is no evidence from the actual timeperiod other than passing references to "Christians" (so what? No one is saying Christians don't exist) and a mention of "Yeshua, the brother of.. ," which was later obviously forged into saying "who IS the Christ", which the writer - who wrote as a Jew, not Christian - could not have written.

I'm fine with there being a person that preached the things that would eventually break off from Judaism, obviously someone had to, but there simply isn't any good evidence for any of it and it's silly to claim there is (most is simply Confirmation Bias). Him existing makes sense in the context of the time (as in the effects that would result from it), so that's why people just go with it. One should take a note from the chaotic 3rd century that we've just been through in the Podcast and remember all the times Mike had to say "..If he/she even existed at all". Some things are presumed roughly true for a cohesive narrative.

But no textual account could ever be sufficient to believe anything miraculous what-so-ever. How could you be? You're not justified in believing something someone tells you directly, so how does them doing magic become more believable with being scribbled onto a letter and kept in a box for a few centuries?

That is why I'd say that having "Jesus word" in living memory isn't relevant (besides just being an assertion). He'd just be a revolutionary rabbi then, so it'd be fine to disagree with his interpretations. The relevancy of his own words is contingent upon his being the "Messiah" which he supposedly showed through 'miracles'/catering. The difference being "This rabbi said.. but this other rabbi said" and "This rab-- Well screw you, God said this!". Which is pretty much the point.

Uh guys, I don't think this is the place for discussions about Jesus. Shouldn't we just be discussing how his believers affected Roman history? We haven't had such a storm in the comments section since way back #93 when Mike recommended Zinn.(Which by the way isn't in the audible recommendations list :O Sorry if I ruined your damnatio memoriae, Mike.)

That being said, I think Mike has handled the topic beautifully and I hope he continues in the same vain as I am learning a lot about the church that my 13 years of Catholic education conspicuously made no mention of.

@ Mainframe
By 'credible' I meant that they try their best not to impose their prejudices on their interpretation of historical events. Personally, I am happy to go where the evidence points. As a rule, historians - John Dominic Crossan, Michael Grant, Rudolf Bultmann, Marcus Borg etc - take a non-literal interpretation of Jesus' 'miracles', unlike theologians.

@ Daniel
I agree that Mike has handled the discussion beautifully. The problem now is that the demarcation between Roman history and early Church history is going to get a little blurred. It is all too easy to reinterpret Roman history with 21st century predilections. The scandals that understandably put people off Christian institutions today were not present for the 3rd and 4th century Romans. With the advent of Christianity, for the first time in the Classical World it seems, pederasty was condemned. Inexplicably, paedophilia does not appear to have been a crime in the pre-Christian Roman World. Three of the so-called 'good' (non-Christian) emperors (Nerva, Trajan and Hadrian), for example, had reputations for liking 'young (under-age) boys'. Christianity acknowledged the equality  of women and slaves with male Roman citizens. In the Classical World, slaves and women usually had no status. In Diocletian's time, 'the Church' had little or no wealth, power or political influence. This made its members easy targets for persecution by the ruling elite.

The sense of community in the early Church, involving charity to the poor and caring for the ill and disabled, meant that its members were more likely to survive war, famine and plague. I think these characteristics made it more attractive than the alternative religions and secular philosophies to Constantine and the average Roman. The Church, however, was not free of serious problems - I hope we hear more about them in future podcasts.

This has absolutely nothing to do with this topic, but I just wanted to give you a massive compliment for your podcast! We listen to it every night before we go to sleep and we both love it. Actually my husband discovered it first (he studied history) and was listening to it from the beginning when I first heard it. So then he was kind enough to start over with me and we're now at the 106th episode. It's so interesting and you have a great voice to listen to. Now we just wished the roman empire would have lasted a lot longer, so we could listen indefinitely. But we could always start over again. Keep up the great work!

I have a question that's I keep asking myself since covering the dissolution of the Tertrarchy:
During the battles of Maxentius and Constantine, and now Maximinius Daia and Licinus, what were the Sassanids doing during this time?  Were they dealing with their own internal problems? It would seem to me to be that during Rome's constant civil war, It would have been a good time to either annex Armenia, or press into Rome's eastern provinces. So what exactly were the Sassanids doing?

An irony I've been buesing for a few episodes is, that I've always associated Constantine with the eastern half of the Empire because of the city he built in Byzantium. But, starting out in Gaul and with Rome in the bag now, Constantine is one of the few emperors I can see who can claim to be ruler of the entire Roman world.

There is always a lot of discussion about Christian persecutions by the Roman emperors. I've always wondered, how unique was this? Is the singularity with which we devote attention to this a case of the victors writing the history? That is, do we give this disproportionate attention because most writers on the subject have themselves been Christian? Who else was persecuted for religious practices in these times and, numerically, who was persecuted more, Christians or other populations?

Iain,

I don't know the actual numbers, but Christians probably were a main target for persecution.

The Romans didn't tolerate dissent, and Christianity was seen as a significant threat, not only to existing religious beliefs, but to the authority of Rome's rulers.

I have been wondering for while now about how life was different in the time of Constantine from say the times of Augustus. Surely the military tactics and social customs must have changed. Would be great if we could have an episode on that.

@ Iain
The reason chirtians were mistrusted was because they wouldn't 'partake' in any celebration of thte old pagan gods!
The Romans didn't care who you worshiped so long as you showed a little bit of veneration to their gods as the protectors of the people.
In the pagon mindset( such as the Romans ) they didn't see the 'big deal' in not doing so as polythiesm was natural to them anyway.
Ironically nowadays we do still celebrate the old pagan festivals but now with a christian make over.

Hi Mike, I really liked Constantine podcasts till now. I read my roman history after Marcus Aurelius always with pain and grudge. In fact after ur final Marcus Aurelius podcast, i didn't listen to next episodes for few weeks. But I have to say you have made later part of Roman Empire history an interesting revisit. I loved podcast on Aurelian; title ‘restorer’ really suits him. I sincerely believed if he had lived 15 more years, Western Empire's life might have increased by at least 75 years. But of course in History if and buts doesn't matter.

I have one request though. I remember u saying it is not possible to extend podcast till Fall of Constantinople.  But can u later do small podcast for great roman figures in republic and empire. I specially thought Cato, Cassius etc. could have got little more pod time.

BTW I read “The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates”, Rome's Deadliest Enemy” completely. I am disappointed but I will take those comments to Adrienne Mayor rather than you :-)

I started The History of Rome at the end of February, and this is the first time I've had to wait for the next episode.  So I've filled the void with other history podcasts and have come to appreciate the quality of what you do: your pace of delivery and the clarity of your story set you apart.  Thank you!

I finally get to ask about things that have made me go "Hmmm..." over the past couple of months:

  - At what point did the concept of "the state" gain acceptance?

  - Did "SPQR" continue to be used during the empire, or was it applicable only to the republic?

  - In my Latin 1 class I learned that librum means book, but I've been puzzled by the actual form books took.  When did the transition from scrolls (or a collection of scrolls since each surely has a finite length) to cut sheets and bound volumes take place?

  - It seems like the internet was alive and well in the ancient world: the speed by which communications and news arrived is impressive; the speed by which individuals or even armies arrived at their destinations is astounding.  Might there exist a "time chart" (sort of like a distance chart) which lays out how long it might take to get from one place or city to another?  Did the Roman "highways" exist outside of Italy?

I'll be poking around the web for answers, but since you prompted the questions, I'd like to give you a crack at answering them.

Mike
I have been following these podcasts since last October, and they are simply the best podcasts I have downloaded on any subject. I think your style and delivery set you apart, and have a mesmeric quality.  I am a big fan of radio and  I find the podacsts are great in th evening when I am about to go to sleep... a sort of book at bedtime.  I am Scottish but live in south west France, so find the stuff about Gaul fascinating.  Many thanks
Carol

The "God" jokes were a bit annoying in the beginning. But, because of the summation and teaser, I forgive you. But, thanks for narrating how a battle can result in a miraculous victory without painting crosses in the sky.

Was there nothing else tactically significant to Constantine's victory other than the loyalty he fostered? Or Maxentius' bad generalship? Did Constantine's Germans have any other secret weapons?

It seems like Constantine sounds like the second coming of the our favorite kid from the Roman slums who ended up conquering the world, Julius Caesar.  While their personal lives are different, it seems like their strategies to acquire power are nearly identical: clemency, winning though vastly outnumbered, seemingly reckless strategies, and very intentionally playing politics while playing soldier.

Did Constantine intentionally follow in Caesar's footsteps, or is it just a coincidence?

Good point! But it seems that Constantine didn't extend his clemency to his Arch-rivals. He did try his best to paint Maxentius as a tyrant and forced Maximian to commit suicide, unlike Caesar who forgave Cicero and Pompey(Had he lived).

I don’t think too many parallels can be drawn between Constantine and Julius Caesar as the clemency they showed wasn’t unique to them.

As early as the Latin War, we saw a policy of generosity and clemency toward former enemies who surrendered to Rome. Also, Aurelian also showed a great deal of mercy during the Palmyrene Wars.  This generosity just seems to be good policy. In contrast, Galba and Maximimius Thrax’s aggressive approach when rising to power was key to their downfalls.

However, the nicely-nicely approach did fail at least once; Macrinus showing compassion towards Elagabalus and Alexander lead to his fall from power.

The version of the battle I had heard previously had Maxentius sabotaging part of the pontoon bridge, with the intention of collapsing it when Constantine was trying to cross. Then follows a little poetic justice when the trap is sprung too early and Maxentius falls victim to his own ploy.
I personally find it far easier to blame poor planning and poor generalship on the part of Maxentius for the disaster as seems to be suggested in your podcast, rather than devine intervention, but I wondered if the 'sabotage' version has been widely publicised and if it has serious recognised sources, or if it was just a case of commentators license at work.

The Milvian Bridge battle seems to me on Maxentius side another typical roman mistake... Generally bad roman generals tend to become dead bad roman generals when they outnumber the enemy.

In general, the best or most successful / the ones we hear from most, are generals who won when outnumbered. It seems that being outnumbered triggers the 'hey lets plan this right' sort of thinking, while having a seemingly endless line of cohorts triggers no thinking beyond the victory celebration. Seen it with carthage, the persians even in civil wars.

Then again, it could all just be a massive re-write to try and depict the victors always as outnumbered to make them seem more 'heroic'... makes you wonder, huh?

In late 2006 excavations on the slope of the Palatine Hill unearthed a buried box containing a set of Imperial Insignia. These have been ascribed to Maxentius, and are assumed to have been deliberately hidden by his supporters after the battle.
They are the only set of Imperial insignia ever discovered, and are identified from ancient writings and carvings.

I understood Constantine's motive, from Micheal Duncan's interpretation, as ambition. It's also clear that Diocletian is mostly to blame for saving the empire from disintegration without providing an institutional bulwark that would unify but stll serve the executive. Instead Diocletian tamed the symptom and split the executive in four. Constantine rose to prominence when there was simultaneously a power vaccuum and four rivals. And, there doesn't seem to be any kind of geographical cohesion. The empire was just too big for its institutions. It doesn't matter if Constantine was Christian or not, or when. It's clear Christianity is not the reason why Constantine won.

As Mike mentioned - that's a far too simple explanation. Rarely is any individual, let alone someone as dynamic as Constantine, ruled by a single charactersistic. Furthermore, Mike hasn't even gotten to the part where Constantine won yet, so check yourself. Religion, belief systems, supernatural propganda, Contantine's own religious ideology, the transforming beliefs of the populus all played a part in this chapter of Roman history, as did the Christian movement.

So, it's not that your wrong, just you didn't say anything right.


I'm just saying this episode focused on one of the most interesting buildups in the ancient world and it was more jumble than clarifying, which may be a product of compromised sources and changed history, but still . . .

@Nate: It's not just Constantine. It's the problems I see with Diocletian's institutional reforms, Duncan talks about this, but not enough. I don't diagree with all the factors you mentioned in Constantine's career. I don't think it's as important as the institutional problems. What shortcomings Constantine might have had just don't matter as much to me. The problem with the biographical approach is, that it doesn't address the structural problems, and it rarely is scientific.

Awesome idea Jeff, that would be awesome.

Good point Rad, the institutional issues are easier to link to effects in an objective way. And you're right, each of us will have our own individual focus when looking at history. Some things may matter far more to you than to me and vice versa, hence method history, which I abhor. But, at least it keeps everyone looking at things from different perspectives.

Can't wait until next week . . .

Galerius has received a bad press in the pro-Constantine propaganda (Lactantius, Eusebius). I suspect he was more of a soldier than a politician: stodgy and unimaginative but loyal to the Diocletian conception of non-dynastic Tetrarchic succession. Constantine came along and wrecked this - and once Constantine made his move Maxentius could hardly be blamed for doing so as well.
More than a conqueror for Jesus I suspect Constantine felt the need to replace the polytheistic ideology underpinning the Tetrarchy with a monotheistic one as befitting his aspiration to be sole emperor - Sol, Apollo, Jesus at least at first didn't matter all that much, as long as it was a matter of only One.

Hey Mike- You certainly keep us wanting more- taking it to the brink of the great battle and then leaving us for more.

I was reading up on Diocletian and I found a few sources (of course not backed up) that say that after he was gravely ill, his retirement was influenced by a strong Galerius.  Could the choices for the new emperors who clearly were his friends be more of a result of Galerius taking advantage of a weak Diocletian?  A kind of 'listen old man- either you make me senior right now, or I'll kill you and go out there and say this illness has finished you off.  Oh yeah- and make these people my new jr emperors.'

You mentioned he may have had something to do with it, but not as threatening as I've read elsewhere.  Is there anything to support it?

The tetrachy can be seen as the first (or at least an early) experiment in seperation of powers. The initial concept of a counsel had two checks, your fellow consel, but also that you had to return to civilian life after a year. Once those were removed, well we all know what happened.

My book recommendation from Audible is "I, Claudius" and "Claudius the God."  I like the unabridged, but there IS an abridged version read by Derek Jacobi, for those who wouldn't have him in any other voice.  The unabridged is quite excellent, though.

Thanks for making Roman history so accessible!  I started listening right before the collapse of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and have been a die-hard listener ever since. :)

Thanks again Mike, having to wait a fortnight really makes me realize how much I love this podcast.

I do have one demand though.... If you ever get around to making your American history podcast, you must charge for it. Say 99c an episode perhaps. I know I for one would be more than happy to pay for something no doubt fantastic. And I'm willing to bet everyone else would agree. The right to do so is always that of podcast maker, but with the quality you produce, you have more than earned it.

Not to steal Constantine's spotlight, but I'm becoming ambivalent about Diocletian. On one hand, there's all his accomplishments and reforms. OTOH, what really worked? Is the criterion, that he aimed so high mere mortals couldn't reach the heights, but did enough to save the empire?

Given the absurd settlement he helped to broker, you get the feeling that Diocletian was either senile or had simply stopped caring about worldly things at this point. I'm imagining him dragged out of retirement to attend this high-level summit, nodding off at the conference table and occasionally rousing himself to say "Sure guys, whatever you say..."

Hey Mike,
  Just wanted to say that this podcast makes my week & it has really sparked my interest in Rome. I mean I'm only a junior in high school & I've already started reading Gibbon.
  Anyway I was curious about Egypt. Back during the episodes on Augustus you said that he claimed Egypt as his own personal possession and that every emperor after him did so as well. I was just wondering, during the years of the tetrarchy, which emperor claimed Egypt? Was it just Diocletian or was it shared equally by all four emperors? And what about after Diocletian abdicated but before Constantine became sole emperor?
  Thanks Mike for all the hard work that you put into this podcast.

Hi Mike,
First I'd like to say how much I appreciate all the work you've done with this podcast (I'm not sure if I've mentioned that before, but it's true). My week pretty much revolves around THOR.

One quick question (a little late, but it's been bugging me for awhile and I thought I'd ask): during the episode "All the King's Men," you mentioned how the office of Praetorian Prefect became central to the Imperial bureaucracy Diocletian established. What I was wondering was did each Emperor have his won Praetorian Prefect attached to his staff? Were there two per Emperor? Or were there simply two residing in Rome as there had been before?
Thank you so much again for doing this podcast, I'm not sure how I would get through each week if I didn't have THOR to look forward to every Sunday.

So what was Diocletian's big misstep? Why did The Tetrarchy fall apart? Did he write laws to bind the Tetrarchs in matters of succession or did he just expect them all to play nice once he was gone?

Great work Mike, your podcast is integral to my morning commute.

Can I simply encourage you not to end the podcast with the demise of the Western Empire, but to continue on with the Eastern Empire - at least to the death of Justinian.

Constantinople is a hugely important and integral part of the Roman Empire, and these citizens were Romans until the fall of the city in 1453.

Without the help of a scholar, a writer with no social life. Many manufacturers of post-graduate degree are satisfied with the service of doctrine, most of whom are holders of masters and doctoral themselves.

Oh, my! Episode 130?

A long way to catch up for me. I just finished listening 20b, and will listen to Interbellum tonight as I go to sleep.

Wonderful series!

Excellent work so far.  Two notes, both a bit random:
-Was listening to Viva La Vida by Coldplay and I couldn't help but think of poor Diocletian.
-I'm currently doing my second listen of THOR and am just wondering why none of Rome's enemies seem to try and adopt the legionary (cohort) model of warfare.  This may be a point to raise on episode 200 for a Q&A session, but I thought it worth mentioning.

     Anyway, THOR is my favorite podcast, so thank you for the award-winning show.

I can't believe the crisis of the third century is already in the rear-view mirror. We still have Constantine ahead of us, and a good deal more besides, but it is, none-the-less, sad to note that there is far more behind us than is left ahead. As we move inexorably towards the fall of the Western Empire you must be acutely aware of this. Are you looking forward to the completion of this gargantuan task you have set for yourself and have attacked with such skill and determination? To putting out that garage-band loop, 'Acoustic Picking 18' for the last time? Or is the idea of pressing on into the Bizantine era starting to tempt you? I know you are playing with the idea of releasing something on American Political History, and there is always the book! Enough then to keep you busy without Rome, but I will certainly miss it, as I'm sure will many others.

I began listening to the podcast last December and I've just this morning, with this episode, finally caught up.

As someone with a BA in Classics and a lifelong love of the ancient world, allow me to say: Great work, Mike. This podcast hits just the right tone between academic dryness and the often too-light tone of popular historical documentaries, etc.

Like the previous commenter, I'd be interested to hear whatever else you decide to do after this, whether it's a continuation of the empire in Byzantium or thehistoryofamerica.typepad.com (for example). Thanks in part to this podcast, I've cracked some of my old college textbooks for the first time in years, just to peruse a few pages on this or that topic. I've also started reading The Roman Revolution, by Ronald Syme, which I only read bits of in college, and which might make a good recommendation for your next Audible plug (I'm not sure if it's available as a podcast but it's good stuff either way).

Cheers, keep up the good work, I'm looking forward to the final collapse!

Mike-  While I know this show must be a lot of hard work and your looking forward to moving on to other things, I think that it would be a disservice to the Empire if you concluded the show at the fall of the west. Rome, after all, was much more than a city. The people of the "Byzantine" empire thought of themselves as Roman, no matter that the actual city of Rome was not under their control (most of the time). I hope you would at least consider devoting a short series of shows (20 or 30) to the east, highlighting the major points of history and culture. I personally have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that in the east, the Empire lasted damn near into the modern era, falling in the 1400's (I think...) and I hope you'll help me and those like me out by going over the history of the east and It's impact on history.
   Whatever you decide, THANK YOU for all of your hard work. Your show is the best historical podcast out there by far. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that every time a new show comes out, it is the highlight of my day. Thank you.

I'm actually quite depressed. I've only been listening to the podcast for about two months now, and I am on episode 105 (when there's not much to do at work, I tend to listen to about 10 episodes). Still, I take solace in the fact that you're continuing to make episodes. Thanks for renewing my love for all things Roman. Oh, and please tell me you're going to do another History of Rome tour of Rome? I just heard the episode where you announced the first one yesterday, so it's a bit late for me to gather the funds.

Thanks for a job well done

Just to say a few episodes or so back Mike did say the was a few episodes left on the last tour. I don't know if that is still so but if you can get the time off it is worth checking the website www.historyofrometour.com and contacting the guys organising it.

Thanks Ben, I checked it out and saw that there were going to be more tours this year, and the hopes of even more in the future. That makes me feel much better. It has been my dream for a very long time to go to Rome, but not on a cheesy tour that just takes you to see the normal "touristy" sites. I trust that Mike will provide an excellent trip, so in the next round of tours, you can put mine and my wife's name on the list.

Really appreciate this support Mike & what a lovely surprise to find this on my favourite podcast. This is truly what the internet has provided for us, a means to communicate & show care for our fellow human. In years gone by mention of New Zealand would have been nothing more than an obscure reference to many.

Christchurch is our 2nd largest city & the devastation equates to 5x Katrina in relative scale to population base & economy. Sorry not wishing to denigrate anyone with this reference just trying to indicate the scale of the event on our small nation.

Thanks to everyone for your kind words.
It is a small world after all.

Just finished listening to your pod this morning on the History of Christianity. I know I know not your area of expertise but really enjoyed your clarity of thought around an history that is often shroud in a lot of rhetoric. Anyway just got back from a week in Rome and thanks to listening to History of Rome for a few years it really enhanced the experience It has a hoot to see statures of all our favourite emperors. So it hasn't just been an elaborate story you have made up. But this was real!  I have gone back a re listened to some of the older pods especially the ones at the time of Caesars death etc as I was staying not far where he was meant to have met his demise.

Making a mental note - give some money to Mike!

Got a lot of us thinking about our Kiwi Kin and the lovely people of Japan who are in such despair. Have just seen the latest footage from the moment the tsunami hit...thoughts and prayers are with them....

Hi Mike.  Ive been listening to your podcast since episode 20'ish or so.  Ive always been slightly interested in Roman history, but your podcast has given me a real taste for it.  When I got up to date with the podcasts, I went back to the start & am listening to them all over again! I love Mike's humour which really suits those crazy Roman personalities.  Not looking forward to the end of the Empire (not a spoiler I hope fans), but am looking forward to Mikes next project.  Any ideas Mike? British empire, Mongolians perhaps?

Star Wars: Red Harvest

Star Wars + zombies + shameless allusions to the movie Taken all thrown together in a dark Harry Potter-esq school setting that actually manages to be scary or at least highly disturbing. I mean really, what more do you need? Cannibalism, ents, a narrator that sounds disturbingly like Jared Harris. I can barely count the reasons why I love this book and it's well worth a read/listen.

I couldn't help but compare Diocletian to George Washington and his decision not to seek a third presidential term, especially when the issue of 20-year reigns came up. The American founders were by all accounts just as ambitious and jealous of each other as Galerius et al were. Hadn't the Romans read their Cicero and other Roman sages, as the Americans had?

One audiobook that I particularly enjoyed listening to recently was Ship of Ghosts, by James Hornfischer.  Totally unrelated to Roman history, but a fascinating insight into a little-known action and its aftermath during WWII.

I recently listened to:

I, Claudius and Claudius the God by Robert Graves and narrated by Derek Jacobi (who played Claudius in the brilliant TV series). Wonderfully written and superbly narrated, I loved listening to this (these) book(s).

Hey Mike, another great episode :) A recomendation I have is The Campaigns of Alexander by Arrian, one of the ancient texts, and the best source we have on Alexander the Great. Alexander created the pre-roman mediterranean for some tangental link to the Romans =D Something that has nothing to do with the Romans is A History of China by Hilda Hookham, what I've heard (have it on the audible audiobook, so I have to put heard instead of read I guess) so far is very good. Hope anyone who gets these likes them if they're mentioned.

Robert Harris did a good job capturing the political intriuges during late Republic politics in the Imperium and Conspirata.

On a totally unrelated subject.  Does anyone know if the the fictional universe of Star Wars is based on the history of Roman Empire?  Many people speculate that George Lucas used Roman history as the basis for creating an inter-galactic world in the future, but I cannont find any credible sources that support this theory.

Issac Azimov's Foundation novels were based on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, an awful lot of Star Wars stems from those books.

The coming of the late empire means a change of how we visualize events. I speak for myself but I believe I do so for the collectivity as well.

When I picture the military of the late republic and early empire, I see the lorica segmentata and square shields. You know, the classic Roman soldier look. When I picture the soldiers under Constantine however, I see chainmails and round shields.

Do you plan to address in coming episodes how the military transitioned from the square shield legionary to the later round shield version?

Was there a shortage of square trees?

Jokes aside, I'm sure plenty of history nerds like myself don't know how this came to happen and would like to better understand the logic behind this evolution.

Thanks, and yours is the first of many podcasts in my list. I like it so much that I feel a pinch when I think that we're slowly approaching the end of the western empire, at which point you may go offline.(sigh)

I will go for something diffrent than the non-fiction books that mike has recommend and I will dive into the two roman historical fiction series whic I have.
1st off all there is the warrior of rome series (3 so far and another 1 on the way this year)which I think someone mentioned on last weeks thread. This is more off a history book with fiction in and accurate to the history. It is based in the 3rd century crisis and all 3 books are on audible thou I read them.

2nd off all is the eagle series by Simon Scarrow. It's been out for a while but I've only just got into it but the 1st one is very good and I'm looking forward to the rest. It starts off in claudius's reign, with the invasion off britain. But not all the books are avaliable on audible, but not that really matters.

So if you want to see history through a diffrent glass then here you are. I hope someone else likes them as well.

I enjoy Roman history and I enjoy detective novels, so I enjoy the Marcus Didius Falco books by Lindsey Davis.
Our hero, Didius Falco is a plebian gumshoe living on the Aventine during the reign of Vespasian. There are about twenty books, all on Audible, but not in all markets. Each one focuses on some aspect of Roman culture in addition to the plot. The first one is "The Silver Pigs".
They are all excellent reads.

Though I love novels based around Ancient Roman history , I have always been a big fan of the Italian renaissance, I picked up "The Scarlet Contessa" It is an account of Caterina Sforza's life with her fictional handmaiden Dea as they struggle through the political and moral corruption of Rodrigo Borgia's reign as Pope Alexander.

It is a fantastic read  and I would suggest it to all who love this time period , especially with alot of media interest revolving around this era thanks to Assassins Creed games and The showtime special "The Bogia's" bringing greater attention to these vivid historical characters.

Falco is fine but there is another novel by Lindsey Davis called "Course of Honour". It is a fictional life of Vespasian's Mistress, Antonia Caenis. Every true admirer of Vespasian should read it (Sadly not available on Audible).
Another fine writer of Roman historical novels was Alfred Duggan who was writing about 40 years ago. He chose subjects less popular- one is about Lepidus, the third member of the second triumvirate - another is set in the court of Elagabulus. One of his books "Winter Quarters" is on Audible.

Thanks for the great suggestions everyone.  Here are my favorite audio books of late.

"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" - William Shirer.

A 1200+ page beast that in audio form (60hrs) is a completely captivating listen!  I thought I knew a lot about the Third Reich and it's major players.  This book showed me I didn't.  My favorite factoid: Hitler's surname was nearly "Sheckelgruber."



"Fall of Giants" - Ken Follett

If you read the reviews on Amazon or Audible on this first book in a series of three by Follett about events beginning just previous to WWI, you would think this is a pretty lackluster book.  But as a lover of history, this book is a perfect introduction into the beginnings of this forgotten war, so much of which played into the more familiar events of WWII.  If you have read Follett's previous "Pillars of the Earth" or "World Without End," you'll love this book as well!

Also not a Roman history book, but I've been listening to the Audible version of "1776" by David Mccullough. I was a history major in college, but didn't study any American history, so I knew very little about the American Revolutionary War. It's amazing that the Americans won the war with Britain considering all the setbacks that happened that year. Excellent book and David Mccullough does an great job narrating his book too!

Huge fan of the podcast. Many great book recommendations already. My recommendation is  not a book, but the movie Masada (originally a mini-series from 1981). It is the recounting of the siege of Masada in Judea in 73AD told from both the Roman and Zealot perspective. It also intertwines a good deal of the political culture of Rome at the time and some of the difficulties faced by the Flavians.

I kind of admire diocletian for abdicating. What else would have happened.. almost everyone who was ruler before him had been assasinated. best to leave when you can still enjoy your being old and leave it in the hands of someone capable. To bad it didnt work out quite as planned, that would have been the perfect end right? Did he by the way also wrote down a history about his reign?? I kind of wonder why no-one after him was as capable to maintain the tetrarchy. Somehow the roman empire seems a bith doomed to not being able to maintain stability.

Great episode as always!!

Hi Mike,
I am fan of your podcast 'history of Rome'. I am big fan of roman history although I like republic era more.
The reason I am writing this comment today is I never believed Constantine was really eligible for suffix/adjective/name "the great". (My grammar is not good. Forgive me for that.) In your Constantine podcast please not fall for this 'greatness'. Ofcourse I will really like to listen your view. I think Constantine was called Great emperor just because of Church. I will definitely like to elaborate on this when Constantine podcast is over.
I am just not convinced he was better than Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian and of course Diocletian. But as I said I always respect your opinion. Hence I am eagerly waiting for that podcast.

On other topic . I have started reading 'Poisoned King- Rome's deadliest Enemy'. I read introduction and I am disappointed. Theer is no need to portray Mithridates as 'freedom-fighter' against Roman Imperialism. I think it will be completely wrong. But I am planning to read it completely and I will like to sent my 0.02 cents worth of comments to you. Because Mithridates spent major part of whole life fighting Rome, hence its better to send my comments/opinion to you.
Regards,
Asiacus

It's a fantasy series, but the Codex Alera series (First book is Furies of Calderon) is an awesome Lost Roman Legion story written by Jim Butcher who also wrote the Dresden Files. Highly recommended. Especially as you learn more and more throughout the series why the governmental structure in the book is the way it is based on the challenges the Romans faced when they found themselves in this strange magical world.

Pretty good job distilling the history of the early church. One correction I would make: Jesus' resurrection took place three days after the crucifixion. Christians (like myself) hold that Christ rose from the dead, and then returned to heaven 40 days after that. The second coming is a separate event entirely, though you are right to point out that it was seen as imminent much more in the early church then later.

As for the rest, that's where if people ask, tell them to go find a "History of the Church" podcast. ;)

I very much enjoy the podcast: keep up the good work!

Mike, long time first time. Do you know of any estimations of the size of the Christian population in Rome at the time of the Great Fire?

I was always curious why Nero would blame Christians for the fire if their population was negligible, which I would assume it would be given that it was so close to the assumed date of the Crucifixion. I'd be real interested if you found anything I couldn't.

I think I'm going to cry when you get to Romulus Augustulus, and this podcast ends! Keep up the stellar research.

The term diocese and ultimately archdiocese have their root word origin in the name Diocletian(I am not sure if you mentioned that). I find that ironic, and yet, the various schisms in Christianity probably caused more internal suffering than Diocletian's minions ever could.
P.S. If anyone's interested, Fire in the East and King of Kings(harry Sidebottom) are absolutely kick-ass novels covering the the period of the Illyrian emperors...I just finished 'em ....can't wait til last of the trilogy comes out....
GREAT JOB MIKE!

On a tour of the Colosseum some years ago, our guide mentioned that no Christians were fed to lions in the amphitheatre, this "entertainment" was performed at the Circus Maximus only. Perhaps those attending THoR Tour will be able to clarify that point.

@Luise from Tasmania

As I am a licensed Tour Guide of Rome, I hope you will permit me to clarify this point about Christians and Lions.

It is the popular myth that Emperor Nero threw Christians to the Lions in the Colosseum that is often debunked by Tour Guides -  on the grounds that it is technically impossible since the Colosseum was built after Nero's death!

Nero did persecute Christians in his private "circus" (not the Circus Maximus) which was where the Vatican is today. He crucified many, including Peter, and sometimes set fire to the crosses to light his circus.

However many "regular" convicted criminals were  executed at the Colosseum (usually as lunchtime entertainment), and it is highly plausible that the occasional early Christian would have met that fate. These executions sometimes involved being torn apart by wild beasts, and sometimes two convicts were manacled together and given swords - survivor goes free! Lots of other unpleasant things too - those Romans were nothing if not innovative.

This idea that some Christians had died in the Colosseum became the reason used by Pope Benedict XIV to declare the Colosseum a sacred place in 1740. On Good Friday the Pope still conducts the Via Crucis inside the Colosseum.
This sanctification of the ancient amphitheatre had the happy result of preventing the further removal of stone for building churches and palaces in Rome, thus preserving it for us to enjoy today.

For information - the general program for the games was
Morning - "venationes" = animal fights with the specially trained Bestiarius fighters.
Lunch - public executions
Afternoon - "munera" = gladiator fights with all the favorites like Secutor, Retiarius, Thracian etc etc in well choreographed entertainment.


I hope this was helpful.

Mike, I love the podcast and have listened to every episode.  I have learned so much and there are so many lessons that can be applied to today.

I concur with Brandon Minich above.  Christians believe that Jesus has already risen from the dead and that he will return from heaven to end human history as we know it.

Otherwise I loved the podcast and can only wish someone would do a series on Christian history as skillfully as you have covered Roman history.

My fourth novel, The Martyrs, written in 2005, details Diocletian's 20 year rule & the great persecution of 304, while telling the story of St. Justina & St. Cyprian.

Sorry, Benjamin, but "diokesis" may have been a term that existed before Diocletian, but only in Greece and only among Greeks. "Diocese" replaced the Latin term "Provincae"(Roman Province) per Diocletian's reorganization of the Roman empire. Maybe it's just a coincidence that his name and the Greek term are similar, but the man, the Roman man, gets the credit for the reorganization. The Romans were masters at adminstration and law, the Greeks were not (they still aren't). Anyone who simplistically and foolishly believes that Roman culture is just a rip off of Greek culture needs to be reminded that the Romans did not steal any more from the Greeks who came before them, than the Greeks stole from the Hittites who came well before them.

To end, too bad Mike mispelled "persecution," but he's not perfect nor does he get paid for this nor is this his dissertation but rather a blog. Relax.

If so, there's a great app I've found that makes it so much easier.

Podcaster app (<a href="http://www.nextdayoff.com/)">http://www.nextdayoff.com/)</a> is great because it lets you search for and download podcasts right to the iphone, without using the computer or the dreaded itunes at all.

It's not free, but in my experience well worth the $2.  (And no, it's not my app and I don't benefit in any way.)  Just wanted to share.

Since the "u" in dux is short, the vowel sound would be more akin to the sound in "put." So it would more or less rhyme with English "books."

It's a great podcast. I knit to it, commute from Brussels to Ghent to it, and look forward to it very much. In the past few episodes you've been retreading old ground for me, since I grew up obsessively reading the novels of Rosemary Sutcliff. Her excellent novel 'The Silver Branch' is set in southern Britain in the period of Carausius and Allecto, and taught me all I know about that period of Roman history. So I enjoyed hearing about it frm the historical side rather than the fictional side. I'm now looking forward to when you get to the withdrawal of Rome from Britain, when you meet up with her even better novel 'The Lantern Bearers'. Also Rudyard Kipling's short stories in 'Puck of Pook's Hill', set in the reign of Maximus.

Patrick, Steve:

I've seen both pronunciations suggested, but the "put" vowel is more common. Regardless, the Romans lacked the schwa sound of English "ducks."

The plural of "dux" is "ducēs." That's "u" as in "put" and "e" as in Spanish "que" (though twice as long as the short vowel. That might sound less silly than having it sound the same as English "ducks."

Alternatively, one could simply use the English words "duke" and "dukes."

After the Chaos of the Third Century I am shocked that the Romans didn't actually lose any territory. Was this because the situation was not as dire as you made it out to be? Or is it because they where besieged by raiders and not conquerors?

Not as dire? The 3rd Century was nigh apocalyptic. I think they so survived so intact (geographically at least) because the Romans got lucky with getting the right leaders at the right time. Gallienus and Claudius led vigorous campaigns that smacked the Goths around a lot and led them to turn down the heat on their border with the empire.

In the West, Postumus led a robust defence of the Rhine that stopped the Franks taking over Gaul.

In the East, just as it seemed Sharpur would seize the Eastern Empire, Odaenathus came out of nowhere and beat the Sassanids back. Then, when Sharpur died, the Sassanids had a succession crisis.

After that, Aurelian comes along and reunites the Empire so that once again Rome is the major power in Europe.

However, they did lose some territory. I think it was in Ep. 118, Aurelian evacuates Dacia so they lost that slice of the Empire.

This is what I picked up from listening to THoR though, I could have misconstrued what Mike was saying.

Lamanna,

Usually the Romans simply used the name of the two consuls appointed that year. For example, here's a bit from Caesar's Commentary on the Gallic Wars:

"Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls, incited by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled all in valor, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul."

There you go. That's the "number" of the year, the year of "Piso-Mesalla." This was common even after the Empire came about, though you could also refer to the regnal year of the current Emperor (hence the Gospel of Luke's "In the fifteenth year of the Emperor Tiberius...").

When absolutely necessary (to compare very distant events, for example), Romans would use a dating from the founding of the city of Rome (by tradition 753 BC).

See generally: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar#Year_numbering">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar#Year_numbering</a>

Very interesting! Listening to how Diocletian completely marginalized the Senate and set himself up as "your lord and god", I was reminded a lot of Domitian. Except that it seems Diocletian was much more effective at establishing his much more autocratic rule and wasn't unreasonably paranoid.

Hi Mike, thanks for all the work you put into the podcast - I have learnt so much!

Anyway, I am playing catch up and just recently listened to the 100th episode with the listeners' questions. I now have two questions having listened to some more episodes:

1. Several times you have suggested that we will only know the truth about a particular event if we had a time machine. If you did have a time machine, what three events would you most like to find out the truth about?

2. I am trying to get my head around just how bloodthirsty and dangerous the Roman world could be. An incredible number of people meet their end through murder or suicide; this got me thinking, were there more murders or suicides that saw the end of the prominent people mentioned throughout the History-of-Romecasts?

Thanks again for these brilliant podcasts.

Chris

Love the podcast but have a minor quibble: You state  that expanding the bureaucracy was a drain on the economy. Sounds like modern-day right-wing propaganda that all government is wasteful and inefficient. Any facts to back that up? The rest of the podcast seems to contradict the statement; the reforms restored a functioning judicial system, reinvigorated the empire, etc.

Speaking of the army, how did equipment/armor change for the soldiers from the time of Marius to the Crisis years, to the end of the Empire?

I have found these sites very interesting, they deal with Roman Army history.

<a href="http://www.romanarmy.net/index.htm">http://www.romanarmy.net/index.htm</a>


The first one has popup advertising that fronts every page loaded but can be closed, a nuisance but the site is worth a look as it has many diagrams and is well researched. The second is the official site for a military history society. Lots of photos of re-enactments. If you are still thirsty for more, go to..

The Roman legions now use scale mail armour (lorica squamata), seen on the Arch of Galerius in Thessaloniki, instead of the segmented plates (lorica segmentata), seen on Trajan's column. The sword, which might be the long spatha and not the gladius, is now worn on the left instead of on the right. The shields are round and seem to be held with the left elbow flexed at 90 degrees (the rectangular shields of Trajan were supposedly held beside the body with the elbow straight). The helmets appear Germanic with metal nose and cheek guards and metal or mail neck guards.The pilum has also turned into a spear or spiculum. I think the Art of War states that the legions had returned to fighting in phalanges and not cohorts.

Of course, Valerian might not have been the straw effigy most sources claim Shahpur I created. I assume he was burned with full honors either way.

Gaul and Britain, and Egypt and Mesopotamia. Does Italy or Northern Africa even matter anymore? Is the center just rotten?

This is a fancinating time in the Roman story which it is hard for the layman to get information on. I never knew any of this so thanks Mike. Now I know the names I can look deeper into it.
Also facinating is the continued friction between Rome and the Persia peoples and how Rome never really wanted to take over this part of the world Unless you inclucd crassus who really had his own agenda as in power and money.
Facinating that this split continues today.

I thought I mentioned this last week, but I don't see it in the comments there, so I'll try again:

I think it would be lovely to devote an episode to the declining influence of the _city_ of Rome within the sphere of the _empire_ of Rome.  I know it's been mentioned a few times in passing, but I think it'd be quite useful to be able to see the progression within the narrative scope of a single episode.

Love the show!

I'm slightly confused, if the impetus for conflict with Carausius was his corrupt tolerance and exploitation of piracy and allowing Romano-British towns to be burned as stated in a previous podcast, how is it that he could secure the loyalty of the british populace and earn the support of the merchants and soldiery of britain? great podcast series, just wondering.

Hi Mike,

In this episode you talked about the challenge you have managing the narrative now with four emperors on the scene, and wanted to comment.

A while back you commented that you wanted this to be a history of Rome rather than Roman "Leaders".  This worked Ok in the early years (while Rome was small), but these days, it is wholly unclear what is going on in the empire itself (as distinct from the activities of the Emperor).

In an earlier episode you talked about everyday life - it may be time for a refresh.  You could talk about things like tax structures and their impact on how/where people lived, the origins of the various titles (Count, Duke, etc), emergence of private armies (deference forces?) in inner  provinces, main sources of "wealth" (industry and/or trade), etc.

Thanks,

SamB

Mike-haven't listened to this episode yet, but I'm wondering if I can request a "catch up" episode after finishing Diocletian similar to the episodes between Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. I know we're rapidly approaching Constintine and with him Christianity and the rapid cultural and religious changes there, but outside of the passing mention in one of the Aurelian episodes, seems like we haven't heard much. Is there enough source material from this crazy 3rd Century to get a good life at the common Roman (and increasingly Barbarian) citizen and what they were doing, feeling, and believing?

Hey there Mike, great episode as always (even if I had to wait 'til the afternoon for my fix since the episode didn't show up in iTunes on my phone, but that doesn't really matter.)

Just one question though. I get that Diocletian was using his association to the gods to cow the soldiers and give himself legitimacy so that the army couldn't just overthrow him, but did the soldiers just accept this and resign their right to appoint the emperor?

I would have thought Diocletian was viewed as just another usurper who wasn't even a soldier's soldier (like say Aurelian) so I would have thought they would have just rolled their eyes at divine pretense. Or was it just Diocletian's top notch political skill that allowed him to get away with saying that he was appointed by Jupiter?

Apologies if you have answered it and I just didn't pick up on it.

"I’m committed to seeing it through to the end. We should be able to get to the abdication of Romulus Augustulus by Christmas 08 (but I only say that to keep morale up – I know it’s going to run longer than that)."

Mike Duncan I will be sad if you finish thor and don't end up doing another history podcast project of some sort. Why not do a history of China from 10,000bce to the present :) Or maybe something more niche that most people don't know anything about already?

It's really nice history. I listened P-Squared interview. The Caligula's tomb thing seems to have been wildly exaggerated. Thanks for sharing this one.

Very happy Mike DIDN'T say "award winning" again. Once was enough as a tip-of-the-cap to the fans but anything more than that implies that Mike is a braggard and that he needs the Podcast award to justify his podcast (and THOR is so good that he doesn't need to brag or justify himself).

Of course, if iTunes were to publish that THOR won an award, that would be great as it would hopefully draw more people in.

We're coming to the point where we can contrast THOR's style and Lars Brownworth's style directly when it comes to this history. It seems to me that Brownworth almost always takes the source material as given and doesn't question it while THOR will take a more open and skeptical view. Contrast this most recent podcast with Brownworth's 12 Byzantine Rulers podcast on Diocletian.

Fantastic podcast Mike,

I just saw this fascinating article linking the crisis of the third century to a period of climate variability, discovered through the analysis of tree rings in wooden artifacts:

"Wet and warm summers occurred during periods of Roman and medieval prosperity. Increased climate variability from 250-600 AD coincided with the demise of the western Roman empire and the turmoil of the migration period," the team reported.

"Distinct drying in the 3rd Century paralleled a period of serious crisis in the western Roman empire marked by barbarian invasion, political turmoil and economic dislocation in several provinces of Gaul."

I was reading that Aper did translate as 'wild boar' in Germanic languages. At least that is how it was described in Kousoulis' book on Constantine. Either way, this is an exciting time period, I'm really looking forward to Sunday's episode. Thanks Mike.

I came aboard late, started with Augustus, and now I'm finally caught up!  I guess I'll be going back to the beginning to learn more about the Republic and the earlier period, now.

I've been a semiprofessional numismatist (which is to say, a coin collector and smalltime coin dealer) for several years, and I got involved with Roman coins a little while ago.  They swept me up into the whole historical drama, and taught me a lot I didn't know about that period in time (since the public school education I received was very weak in ancient history and the Classics).

Anyway, since we just passed Aurelian and Mike had an episode entitled "Restitutor Orbis", I would like to offer a Roman coin giveaway.  I have a nice silvered bronze antoninianus (double denarius) coin of Aurelian, which just so happens to have the "Restitutor Orbis" reverse on it.  It's of modest value, but not your typical junkbox Roman coin, being worth $35-40 or so.  (Remember Mike mentioning the terrible inflation of the period, and the debasement of the coinage?  Well, by this time the previously-silver antoninianii coins were little more than bronze with an thin outer wash of silver, which didn't always survive being buried in the ground for 1,700 years).  This one's pretty nice, though, with sharp detail and a fair amount of the original silvering intact.  It was part of my original collection. (I've since downsized and am focusing exclusively on coins of the "12 Caesars".)

If Mike approves, perhaps he could post a giveaway thread here, and everybody who's listening could post one reply.  I could then randomly select a winner a few days or a week or so later (using a random number generator), and ship the coin to that person.  (If he decides to do this, I can post a link to some pictures of the coin later- I haven't got any at the moment.)

Just let me know if anybody's interested.

What's the source on "aper" as "ass"?

I typically translate it as "wild boar." "Ass" (as in donkey) in Latin is "asinus."

Just wanted to agree with those who are pointing out that 'aper' means 'wild boar' not 'ass' or donkey, which is asinus. Also, it's pronounced AH-pear.
I absolutely love this podcast! Thanks for putting in the work.

When you first "subscribe" to THOR podcast on iTunes, they point to 100+ episodes, and they include #1 (Romulus), but then skip 30+, making it impossible to get started.

I truly wish I could join you on one of tours but the podcasts keep me very very happy, every Monday/Tuesday my Mac is downloading your latest podcast. I am keeping them all permanently.  I pass my regards to Mrs History of Rome, she must be very proud of your winning and what you are doing for us all as well as patient as it must take you some time.

Secondly, as a fellow Texan I say welcome, Bienvenidos (San Antonio). Third, I was wondering if there is anyway you could post a general biography. I am looking for a book you referenced, and I cant quite remember which episode it was, or the exact title, since all my searches for the book itself have come up with nothing. Keep up the good work.

@Jacob C. On facebook there is a group for the Fans of The History of Rome. Within that page there is a Discussion for the Book List or Bibliography on The History of Rome.  Also other listeners book recommendations.
There is always going to the Audible site at audible.com/THoR and seeing if they have the list of Mike's recommendations listed there. Perhaps even purchasing your finds at that time:)

@ Mike and Brandy
Merry Christmas and a Healthy, Happy, Peaceful and Prosperous New Year! Thanks very much for the many happy hours.  You have carried me through some tough times and I'll always be grateful I found you before some of the really tough stuff started.

Congrats Mike well deserved win.

I have a question:

In your podcast you say that Aurelian had posted Probus to command of the eastern provinces. I had always thought that Tacitus was the one who had appointed him to that position and it was Tacitus who may have been grooming Probus for succession. So the reason Probus didn't vie for the purple after Aurelian's death was he wasn't in position to do so until after Tacitus' death.

I couldn't give you a book citing because to be honest I can't remember where I read that but a quick google search, for what its worth ,came up with this.  <a href="http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/probus.html">http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/probus.html</a>

Io Saturnalia

Congratulations on the award, it is well earned.

Although I've had a professional interest as an archaeologist in the Roman west, your clear presentation and style help make the events in the later empire easier to follow, and I've recommended it to friends with an interest in this period.

May I also suggest reading Stuart Laycock who has written on late/post Roman Britain which suggests reasons that Rome made no lasting impact on Britain, and how the Anglo-Saxons were able to occupy most of the island.

Laycock, S. (2008)Britannia - The Failed State: Tribal Conflict and the End of Roman Britain, Tempus Publishing

also by the same author (which I've yet to read)
Warlords: The Struggle for Power in Post-Roman Britain
Unroman Britain: Exposing the great myth of Britannia

Thanks again

I read somewhere that after Aurelian's death, the Senate passed a measure to damn his memory and strike him from history. Seems like a very odd thing to do to the Restitutor Orbis. The measure was eventually overruled, but how did it ever take place to begin with???

Congratulations on the award. I have to say you more than deserve it.

I have only just caught up with the latest podcast as I have been listening on my 2 hour daily travel to work and back most days for the past 4-6 months. I've not really read/research much on the history of rome but I have loved every minute of this podcast. The way you tell it could be just as good as any make believe story which has been told.

Anyone happy new year all my fella listeners as well as the Mr & Mrs Rome

Brilliant Mike, well done on the award, and richly deserved.

On Stephen George's comment about Roman Britan below; I have embarked, sadly on a History of England from the time of Cerdic (519), in frank imitation of THOR. Does that sound creepy?

Anyway, I also enjoyed 'Britain AD' by Francis Pryor - it's a slightly grumpy book, but gives an interesting take on the period between the end of the Roman Empire and the Anglo saxon Invasions.

Presumably you can't read all this stuf though !

Hey, so as luck would have it was just updating my "History of Rome" photoset on Flickr.  And added an image of Emperor Tacitus appearing on a coin from the NY Met:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/griffin2000/5323330570/#/photos/griffin2000/5323330570/in/set-72157622984533639/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/griffin2000/5323330570/#/photos/griffin2000/5323330570/in/set-72157622984533639/</a>

Congrats on the prize, and, yeah, I concur that this is the best podcast out there by some stretch.

BTW any chance of another episode dedicated to military tactics (along the same lines of the "Phalanx with Joints" episode from early on.  There has been some mention of the various changes in military tactics that occurred as as the late Imperium progressed, but I'd appreciate another in depth discussion of it.

Thanks again

Hello!  First of all,
I just started listening and burned through all the podcasts in just over a month it seems.  Was great listening to them one after the other, but now here I am waiting with the rest of everyone.

I truly cannot thank you enough Mike.  The dry humor is perfect, the history is well spoken and truly makes me feel like I'm experiencing it.  You are amazing and would be a fantastic narrator for any audiobook.  When you finally put together the book by the way, I will be amongst the first to buy it.

Congratulations on the well deserved award (I was fortunately caught up just in time to vote) and I look forward to hearing more and more of not only The History of Rome but anything else you choose to pick up on.  I am a die-hard follower for sure =)

Thanks again Mike and best wishes to you and you're family,

Ninjaheman

P.S.
I missed out on question day but I have a question about Caligula that is rather terrible so I'll keep it as clean as it can get.  I'm wondering if it's true;  did Caligula impregnate Drusilla and whilst pregnant he disemboweled her to bring out the fetus because he was too anxious for his "god of a son" to help him rule?  Another version says he raped her anally, killing her in the process and then took the child from the womb, this would have of coursed killed both in the process.  I'd cite the sources but one I cannot find and the other came from my history teacher.

If this rather touchy topic ever finds its place in the narrative I would be extremely satisfied to finally know the truth.

A glass break sensor however has the capacity to detect the actual sound frequency caused by a window being broken and this frequency would then trigger the alarm.

This is a fantastic series. (VERY well written.) I'm a casual history fan, and I found this podcast completely by accident.  I'm now on episode 30, roughly 200BC, I can't wait to get in the car everyday and pick up where I left off.  Thank you!

It will be awhile but what are your thoughts about a joint podcast episode with Lars Brownworth on Constantine?  One Empire, One podcast...something like that.  It'd be epic.

Fingers crossed on the award.

Long time listener, first time commenter. Lord, I feel like I'm calling into a radio show saying that.  I'm a lover of ancient Rome (especially the Republic, but thats long gone now) and these podcasts can't help but depress me.  Not on the podcasts themselves, they are excellent, but the time period.  The Western Empire is moving towards its end, and besides the small bright period still ahead, with Diocletian and Constantine and few others, only downfall awaits. Oh well, thats what 1500 years of hindsight will do! Still, amazing podcast.

Congrats on your Podcast win.

Great episode. Probably one of the top 5 of the series. Definitely underrated Emperor. I would love to hear more of the implications of his early "retirement" at the hands of, well, the usual suspects. No doubt that Christianity was in full flourish by now and the implications of the "Son of God" and "Sol Invictus" can be linked in more detail.

I'm so glad you won the Podcast Award! You beat Hardcore History, which is also a great show. I think this proves that your simplicity and style are a great boon to this subject. Learning about Aurelian is great too. He seems to have been lost in the huge chasm of crappiness between the Severans and Diocletian.

Hi Mike, Congratulations on the nominations, I voted today and plan to vote for as long as we can. I have a question, whenever I picture the legionaries of the empire throughout the podcast I always wonder what armour and weapons they used, and when they were used and when they stopped using specific armour and weapons. For example In the video game "ROME: Total war", before the Marian reforms shows republican legion infantry with a mix of plate and mail armour, after the marian reforms legions have a lorica hamata, or segmentata, combined with a reinforced gallic helmet and scutum, so i would like to know if they immediately switched after the reforms or is it was a gradual process. So I was wondering if you could give us examples what they used in different periods in Roman history and when. I know i'm probably kind of late asking this since we are past the Marian reforms so maybe you could stick it in when you talk about the reforms of Diocletean and Constantine. Thank you very much in advance if you could do this.

Outstanding podcast.  I ran across this podcast on a podcast app for my Droid, the episode was "Black and White and Severus All Over." When I finally got to your website I thought I was in heaven, hours and hours of podcasts about Rome from start to Severus.

Ironically I had been to your website several times before during some random search for Roman history.  Not realizing what I was looking at I would return to the google results.

Long winded way to say thanks and keep up the great work!

Mike..I have Just voted and will as long as I can.  I am 64 years old and all my life I have been interested in The Romans.  Thank you for this amazing History which you explain in a professional yet relaxed manner you make me feel "involved".  I live in the North of England not far from Ribchester where there was a Roman fortification, not much left of it today, The truth is both the UK and USA owe so much to the Roman Empire if the people did but know it, it is often said there is nothing new under the sun and look at all the wheeling and dealing etc that goes on in our world well as you explain it was all there in the Roman empire with politicians and hangers on etc.

Sorry I got here late to the party--- I was saving up "Palmyrene Wars" until this weekend!  Voted today, and I'll flip the switch for you every time I'm allowed.
Y'know--thought I wouldn't like this podcast much.  I've been a devotee of Roman history (Tacitus is God!!) since college, and I figured that there was nothing new here.  But it's really, really fantastic to hear another voice on all these sources, putting it all together in such a succinct and clever way.
Way, way cool, dude!  THoR rox-- may it ever wave!

I forgot to tell you, in the comments with my first vote I did say it was a shame that THoR wasn't in The Best Overall as it really more than education. Many of us know some or all of the stories.  It's really about entertainment and relaxation.  As expressed so well by many of your regular listeners.

I did notice that one show was in more than one category.  Next year we'll do it again as you will have ended in 2011. Now that we know there is a time to vote for the shows that should be included in the ratings we can vote for THoR to be in more than one category for the Podcast Awards and then we can vote for all of the categories you end up in.  THoR for a sweep in 2011!!

Ave:)

Hey Everyone,
I am a longtime fan of THOR and am listening to the current episodes with the utmost enjoyment. I was just wondering if Mike or another listener could expand upon how the Praetorians fit into the current political and military system in Rome. They were briefly mentioned in “Aurelian’s Walls” as supporting Quintillus’ short lived bid for power.  My main questions are:

Have they become completely irrelevant due to their role as kingmaker shifting fully to the provincial armies?

Are they even nominally connected to the current emperor?

Are they still serving as a kind of elite reserve army like in Severus’ time?

Is the guard that has been mentioned serving in Italy some kind of unofficial Italian defense force?

I would appreciate any information that you can offer, and wish to again thank Mike for creating such an engaging and insightful podcast.

One thing has always struck me as odd about the Roman Empire. When you look at how large it was, why didn't they focus on expansion north more. The Germanic areas are the closest, and really pretty close, to the capital. What good is control of Britannia and the Black Sea coast if the front door isn't protected?

Woohoo, more THOR! Thanks for your work, Mike. Much appreciated.

Recognize this weeks' images from looking up Aurelian, knowing my lack of knowledge on the man. Since most of what I know about ancient Rome I learned from you (and lots of geography/countries from 'Europa Universalis: Rome' :P ), I used to have Marcus Aurelius and Aurelian conflated into one vague figure untill you reached the Good Emperors.

":(" for school mainly going "Here's a map of some greek colonies and a couple of Important Events, then Rome rose to own all of this, now let's study why Rome fell!" then moving on to more recent history after discussing migrating peoples. At least that's how I remember it, thanks for unclouding this vast era of the western world.

Mike,

The commentary on the walls was great. It seems to me that this should be a candidate for the distinction of the End of Antiquity. It's not clear to me whether imperial Rome was a superstate, suprastate or something else altogether, but if this was the end of frontier defense then this must be when Europe started fracturing into feudal entities.

Every mayor for himself...

Hi!  I'm a new listener.  I thought I would post a comment on this episode (since it is the most recent), but in fact I am plodding along chronologically, so I'm still back with Augustus at the moment.  (I opted to begin listening around the time of Julius Caesar, but I may go back to the very beginning later.)  Anyway, I just wanted to say "thanks" for all your terrific work- it has really livened up some of my dull nights working graveyard shift.  As a night auditor in a resort hotel, I have to keep my eyes and hands busy typing data into accounting spreadsheets, but my ears and my mind can travel back in time, thanks to your fine podcasts.  I really appreciate it.

As Packherd mentioned, I also love the commentary on the walls! I always wondered how western europe went from being all cool and classically antique to all lame and middly evil. But it makes perfect sense as a military strategy when you have one superarmy trying to defend all the spread out towns from random barbarians all the time.

Have just caught up with the first 116 episodes. Love it - I feel I've learnt so much.

If anyone is interested, a radio adaptation of I, Claudius is currently being broadcast on the BBC. To listen go to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qfz6">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qfz6</a>
(there are only 6 days left to hear episode 1). I think you can listen outside the UK. Derek Jacobi is in it, but this time as Augustus.

Hi Mike,
We are a family of four who are currently trundling around Argentina in a camper-van listening to the History of Rome podcasts.
We're only at #78 but we're catching up to current pretty quickly.
I just wanted to drop you a note to let you know how much we're enjoying the podcasts - the kids (2 boys, 10 + 14) particularly.
Keep up the good work

@pb I have all the episodes in shuffle on my iPhone.

Another great episode as always, I'm really digging all of your crisis of the third century episodes. I all makes sense for the first time in my life.

Your podcasts on the 3rd century crisis is outstanding. I just have one question for you. After you mentioned the mobile calvary organized by Gallienus, I tried to dig up more about that on the web since a elite Roman calvary army is really some thing interesting. Yet I was unable to find much about. I would really appreciate it if you could talk more about it in the coming episodes or provide some reference on the topic.

Thanks for all the good work and I am really looking forward to the episode on Aurellian.

On a completely unrelated note, when the time comes to end the podcast, how about a show or to on the history of the history of Rome, i.e. how the Romans have been seen by people looking back. I really want to know what the medieval Christians thought of the empire, for example, or what Napoleon thought of it.

Yep, another great episode.
And I'm another who believe's Aurelian was one the the greater hero's of the Empire. We often hear how the 3rd century crisis was ended by the reforms of Diocletian. However, imo, Diocletian would have had nothing to reform if not for the super human efforts of Cludius, Aurelian and Probus.

Hi Mike - great job on the History of Rome.

I'm one of those lucky enough to live in Rome, and also to work as a licensed Tour Guide here (I often recommend you to my clients) so the Colosseum is practically my second home.

I was looking at your tour itinerary for next year and just wanted to offer up some friendly comments for your information. I've sent a detailed email to Nathan August and asked him to forward it to you - if it somehow gets lost along the way please feel free to contact me directly.
Once again, great job - keep it up.

Can someone answer a question for me?  What was the official language of Rome at that time for its legal system?
The reason why I ask is that the Bible was written in Greek and why not Latin?

Clarify:
The new Testament was written in Greek and I assume Latin was the official language of Rome but I could be wrong.  I do also understand Rome was comprised of many cultures and languages but its government had to have, I assume, one language for communications.

My understanding is that latin was the official language for state business until Emperor Heraclius changed it to Greek in the early 600s.  I'm assuming that includes the court system.  Heck, we *still* use lots of latin terms in law.

Hi Mike,

I couldn't find an email address to just email this to you, but I wanted to thank you for the effort you've put into this podcast. It's made my hourly walk to and from law school much more enjoyable.

I had two questions, though. (I just passed the 100th episode and I'm still catching up, so maybe they've been asked since then, but I'm still curious.) The first question is about the popular assemblies and what happened to them after Augustus came to power. Were they just disbanded? Was there a public outcry that the populares with whom they sided seized absolute control and pushed them aside? Also, once the principate was put in place, was anyone elected to anything anymore? It seems like around this period the princeps would appoint certain people for certain offices (either straight up or by sham election), but did the princeps do this for all offices or only special appointees the princeps particularly wanted?

I realize that my first question was really a cluster of questions, so my second one is a lot simpler: If you had to choose (and ignore the fact that they weren't really organized factions), would you have sided with the optimates or the populares?

Thanks again!

Much of the eastern empire was the old Hellenistic empire founded by Alexander the Great so many, if not most, would have natively spoken greek rather than latin. The switch fully to greek in the later Byzantine empire is mentioned in the In Our Time episode <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/player?page=38">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/player?page=38</a> a great program in a (mainly) great series.

You have made the history of Rome exciting and enjoyable.  My 11 year old son and I enjoy listening together.

With respect to the greek question for the Bible, my understanding is that the Jews at the time were on the first steps of the Diaspora. The word "diaspora" itself is a Greek word. They were kicked out of Israel in 70 AD. The Christains had not fully separated from the Jews. The Romans certainly did not distinguish between them at that time.

One of the places that was a first stop after leaving the levant was Greece, hence early Greek Bibles.

Hello Mike,

I can't find an email address for you anywhere, and I'm not on Facebook, so there were two things that I was inetrested if you would cover specifcially that I wanted to mention here:

1) Roman Religion - I know you have touched on this in the past, and I would understand if you wait until the rise of Christianity to delve into this further, but I am very interested in how the rise of Eastern cults (e.g. Mithraism, the Cult of Isis, the cult of Sol Invictus, Christinaity) affected the day-to-day functioning of the empire, and the ways in which the Romans looked at the world

2) Barbarian (and Persian) Battle Tactics - I was relistening to some of the old THoR podcasts the other day. One of the podcasts I listened to was "A Phalanx with Joints." You did such a great job of explaining how the old Greek phalanx was no match for the newer Roman legion in that podcast that I became very curious to hear your deconstruction of the Barbarian and Persian battle tactics that eventually brought down the legion. I know that there is a lot more going on with that topic than purely military tactical operations, but I was curious as to how the Roman legion - domninant for so long - eventually met it's match.

You do a great job with this, Mike! Thanks for keeping SPQR alive.

Hi Mike I just want to let you know how much i'm enjoying your podcast, I am a good few episodes behind but i have just spent 2 weeks in tunisia listening to several episodes whilst visiting Carthage and El Jhem, i hope El Jhem is on your places to visit list. It is truly amazing!! Also nearby they have unearthed the remains of a middle class area of a roman town. It is quite something to think the people who lived there over hundreds of years thought that the Empire would go on forever. Anyway thanks again for the podcact

Cheers

Hi Mike, great podcast!
Since I was still catching up at the 100th episode, I wonder if you can put the following issue/question in your narrative (or answer briefly on the web site). I think it is still  relevant at this point of the Empire.

In the last episode, you seemed to imply that the people in the regions of the empire (except Italy)were losing their loyalty to Rome because it could not provide the much needed security anymore.

However, Gaul and (greater) Syria were already 200+ years under roman rule. Had no "romanization" taken place? Was it just the elites (tribe chieftains etc) that had embraced Roman values and had a vested interest to defend the Empire?

In more modern terms, was the Roman Empire just a "holding company" that as long as it collected the dividends (taxes/manpower etc) did not interfere with local customs/education etc?

Again, thanks Mike for this interesting and sharp-witted podcast series.

K.

It seems that Rome's enemies are getting more sophisticated, learning the art of how to put down the "big bully". So maybe fractured management at the top of Roman politics and the army wasn't the only reason for the losses of this period. Leakage of technology and sophisticated learning at the fringes of the romanized world might have played a part. What do the rest of you think about this?

Hi Mike

I've recently moved to Beirut for work, and I love your podcast even more given the centrality of this region in the Empire, and the amazing  Roman ruins throughout the Levant, including in the most unlikely of places. For example, there's a lonely Roman column at the end of my street, and yesterday in the mountains I saw a prohibition chiseled into a rock by Hadrian, banning the felling of four kinds of trees.

I extend an open invitation to you and Mrs The History of Rome to come and stay whenever you wish.  I would be more than happy to take you to Baalbek and beyond.

Great Podcast. I've been listening for awhile and thoroughly enjoy the episodes. Since going to the fall of Constantinople has been pretty much ruled out, I was wondering if we could convince you to take the podcast to the end of Justinian's reign instead? I think it falls neatly into the scope of this podcast as Justinian was the last emperor who really thought on a imperial scale. He sought to retake the empire's lost territories, was the last emperor (I believe) who possessed Rome, and is considered by many historians to be the last Roman Emperor of the East. He still spoke Latin unlike his sucessors and the retaking of Italy is a really amazing story that would be a much better ending to the podcast rather than the disappointing removal and retirement of a teenage boy.

As Erik Rieske said, I'd love for the Podcast to go on for as long as possible after Romulus Augustus. Since I hope Mike enjoys making these shows, it'd be preferable that he expands upon what he's already gone so far into building a cohesive narrative with, rather than jumping to a new era.... Unless it'd be ancient China or something, since I know far too little about the dynasties! :D

After hundreds of years of abandoning territory and depressing defeats both militarily and for their society it'd be nice to end on something on an upbeat note, however temporary, rather than "Well, now the Roman west fell completely and Europe will fall into petty squabbling until the present day. TEH END!".

Although I'm not sure how many more times I can listen to the Empire falling into petty in-fighting about pointless theological nitpicking when there's massive issues all over the country. Makes me want to punch Constantine in the face.

Mike,

Thank you for all of the time and effort you put into this podcast.  I studied ancient history in college and was fortunate enough to have an excellent professor for all of my Greek/Roman classes.  Like him, you do a great job at making history come alive.

I'm also impressed by how much you use the original sources (Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio, etc) and how you explain their potential and occasionally blatant biases.  I'm only on episode 70, but catching up quickly!

Thanks again.

I used to live in the town of Sitges (just south of Barcelona). I loved the drive to Tarragona (Tarraco), the old Roman HQ of Hispania Tarraconensis (Hispania Citerior in Republican days).

There is a fabulous and enormous Roman aquaduct just off the highway into town. There is no tourist office, no queues, no crowds, barely even a sign. It is the best place in the world to take your tea & bikkies, then sit and marvel at Roman engineering. You can walk right across and go down below and gaze up. (Then look  down and wonder at the foundations they must have built underneath!)

The town of Taragonna is also a great place to spend a day (if you can tear yourself away from the aqueduct!)
How can I past a photo?

I only discovered the podcast a few months ago. I have finally caught up and I'm looking forward to 114!

Love the podcast. I'm in the Navy, recently returned from being forward deployed in East Asia, and currently going to graduate school for an engineering degree.  Anyway listening to your podcast has really peaked my interest in the whole period of history and I'm reading a couple books now about the period.  I'm very impressed with how you always mention sources and their potential biases and admit when you're not 100% sure of what might have happened (cause most poly-sci guys think they know everything of course :) ).  Anyway I remember at the Academy we would talk about many of the battles and wars from that era in history and though obviously the weapons and technologies have changed, many of the fundamentals of the Greco-Roman military doctrine and structure are still relevant and practiced today.  Anyway, thanks for the great podcasts, keep them coming.  Cheers.

Excellent the two week hiatus is over!

I've been dying to share a little story regarding THoR all week..

I went into the local bookshop in suburban Melbourne and picked up a new release called "A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities" by J.C. McKeown. Utterly hilarious book detailing some obscure, bizarre and sometimes profane facts about roman life (let's just say Augustus had a filthy mouth).

Anyway so I went to the counter to pay for it and got chatting to the sale guy. Upon seeing that the book was about a mutual interest it took us close to 3 seconds flat to realize we were both THoR nerds. I never realized there were so many of us that we could randomly run into one another!

Needless to say, the point of this story is Ave M. Duncan! May he be as wise as Trajan and as lucky as Augustus.


ps. I also might happen to be in Europe come early next year... is it possible a lone wanderer could share a bear or two with the traveling THoR legion at some point?

Hurrah for the return of THoR!

The "decline" episodes have got me wondering about the life chances of all these usurper generals being hailed emperor. We have heard of a few who succeeded, and a few more who did not. The common theme is that all were dead within a few years - did these guys not read their history?!

@ Benjamin, and anyone else living around / coming through Mogontiacum - Roman themed beers an excellent idea.

That was a long couple of weeks. Has anyone wrested an assurance from Imperator Duncan that he will keep this going until the fall of Constantinople?

In my very humble point, ref the usurper Generals:

The fall of Rome becomes very likely when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and inevitable after the death of Germanicus in my opinion.

Mike made a great point about the living memory of the Kings of Rome. Once the living memory of the republic was fading/gone, probably only Germanicus could have made it a reality once again being both strong enough to withstand military adventurers and principled enough to refuse ultimate power himself. If he could have persuaded Tiberius to step down and lived for thirty years while a Republic was reborn then perhaps the strength of a Republican generation might have stood the test of time.

The history of Rome might have been very different.

Its also a very interesting point ref the British Empire; had the British Parliament started accepting MP's from major colonial cities between the wars then perhaps the Empire would have survived a lot longer.

As we get further along into the waning of the Empire, I hope Mike can spare some thoughts on the European legacy of Rome.

Few things in Western history have been as enduring as the idea of Rome - it's virtues, it's style, it's luxury. Heck, it's why we're all listening to THoR. As a once-upon-a-time student of European politics, that endurance has fascinated me. It shows up in studies of the Carolingians and the HRE, of course, but also is a touchstone for imperial Britain, the Ottomans and the United States. There's even a town in China that claims a Roman connection.

it would be great to hear Mike's perspectives on what Rome meant not just to the Romans themselves, but all the successive civilizations that followed.

I would just like to point out an odd fact of Roman History. Why did the Praetorian Guard, being so large and skilled, never actualy defend Rome against her enemies. Another great example of this was given this week when a 'hastily raised militia' had to beat back the Germanic incursion into Italy. Just seems crazy to me,  or were the Praetorians simply too spoilt and lazy by this time?

"The History of Rome" is a great podcast. Thank you, Mike.
The last episodes are really interesting to me as long as they covered a "grey area" of Roman history - one concerning a period when the historical sources became scarce, but it had deep implications in the future of the prigin of the new countries of Europe.
For example, I'm looking forward to the one of the next episodes about emperor Aurelian (born in Dacia Ripensis) who decided to abandon Dacian provinces north of Danube. The history is not clear about the reasons of the emperor (if it was forced to get out due to Gothic and free Dacian attacks) and what this abandon really means: i.e. was a general retreat or only an army/legions retreat?

Mike,
I agree with Eyal. An episode on gladiators would be interesting however, with experience in trying to write a senior thesis on the same topic, there is only so much information (but looking for everything was the fun part). Yes, many people find the topic extremely interesting and I think it would be, as usual, a great episode to do. One of my favorite books on gladiators is "The Way of the Gladiator" by Daniel Mannix ... another good book is Alison Futrell's "Blood in the Arena"

What I'd love to hear more about is what the art of this time was like. Did the intellectuals have anything to say about this constant turmoil? Were they afraid to criticise the Emperors, or was the Emperor's fragile grasp of power licence to be critical?

Sorry, I'm just catching up on the website tonight as I'm home with the flu and wide awake. Nice maps as well thanks they really work well. It is altogether nice work and great retelling of the battle and the take down of Anthony and Cleopatra.

What did you think of the HBO series, Rome? Wait, I'm sure someone has asked and you've said. I'll just keep mining the comments.

Also, great comments by listeners. I really appreciate the to a fro on one of my favorite subjects since grade school:) which, for a girl, meant social outcast. Not that I noticed, I was in the bookmobile and library happily reading the myths and histories of the old world:D

Getting caught up is great and now reading all of the comments I feel like I shouldn't have let myself fall so far out of step. Boooo Valerie Boooooooo booooo! ha ha

I'm super excited for you & the lovely Mrs. THOR about the trips.  I checked out the company and they are lucky as well to have someone so clearly informed and excited to share the info.

Ha, I was offered a tour leader position ten years ago based on my not as great knowledge but my clearly communicated enjoyment and ability to communicate the history to daily life today.
You have just scored a potentially very fun assignment. Check out Rick Steves gig.

Will you take pictures to illuminate the podcasts please?

Well and maybe everyone who goes that agrees could take video and photos for the site so the plebs could enjoy the tour from the sidelines???

With all the changes happening in the Empire in the 3rd Century, it would be interesting to take another look at the social history of this time period.  How did life change for those in Rome and in the provinces with the ever rotating leadership, the threat of barbarian invasion, etc., influence of provincial/barbarian cultures, influence of emerging religions, etc.

Mike, as usual great stuff. Question, maybe you or someone else can answer: how did actual Roman citizens generally looke like physically?

When you look at shows like Rome or Spartacus, all men are tall and muscular and women are pale and often beautiful.

I'd imagine that archeological research has shed some light on this in the years, but can't really find a decent source.

For what Mike thinks on the HBO series Rome check out the 100th episode (PS it's number 90).
And I'm going on one of the trips and planning on taking some photos, which I'm sure I put up on the facebook page and on the forum (forumgallorm). And Im sure if Mike doesn't take himself (which I'm sure he probably will). He can borrow some of mine if I get chance to take any good ones.

Anyway thanks again great for the podcast Mike

I am new to the podcast and had to actively catch up to your current episode.  I love how you bring the whole thing to life and appreciate the personal touch that makes the whole thing exciting.
Having said that, what will happen when you hit the Byzantine history?  Constantine is a Roman Emperor but I am not sure if one empire ended and another began?  I am also unclear about what happened to all the religions.  I am interested in the transition from Pagan gods to Christianity but I don't understand its whole nature?  I've read tidbits of Roman history and there seems to have been Christian bishops even before Constantine.  What were the religious rankings in Pagan religions?  What kind of power did they wield over the ruling bodies and the common man and given that they existed how did the onslaught of Christianity suddenly snuff the light out of all those religions, especially since there were so many, from so many different provinces?

Combaticus!
Thankyou for the list/timeframe! This is very helpful! (It also appeals to my compulsive obsession with lists.) Bonus!
Whenever Mike is away from his post at THoR I follow a second listening stream of his podcasts. I'm up to 013 The Latin War. It's how I tie over 'till he is back to continue.
At this stage, I won't be able to join a tour next year but will look forward to seeing the photos that get posted. Oh, you will all have so much fun! I'll be with you in spirit!

Mike: Great stuff! New listener here, just found the podcast about three weeks ago. I started at the beginning and am already up to Poor Uncle Claudius. I skipped ahead to this latest episode to add my comment so you'd see it.

One tiny problem - more an annoyance than a problem. iTunes has your episodes all out of order, and many of the descriptions are wonky, giving source URLs instead of blurbs. Any way you could fix that?

Many thanks, and please do keep up the fantastic work. I am glued to my iPod every night.

Mike,

In this episode you mentioned that Gallus had made his way up the Cursus Honorum.  I can't remember the last time the that system was mentioned, and I am wondering what role the Cursus Hororum was playing at this point in the Empire.  Was it still an active part of political life, or was it more or less a nod to "the good old days" that kept going out of shear inertia?  I know that the emperors paid little attention to it when it came to issues such as succession, but what about the rest of the politically ambitious?
Thanks for putting out this podcast.  It's defiantly one of the best.

Hey Mike:

I know you've left these eras of history well in the past, but I was wondering if you knew of any sources for the lives of the two Catos (particularly Cato the Elder).

Thanks for the great work!

To Matt, regarding the physical stature of ancient Romans. In "Caesar's Legions," by Stephen Dando-Collins, the height of the average Roman Legionairre was 5 feet 4 inches. In "Roma," by, Steven Saylor, when describing a 15 foot wide road being built from Roma to Capua, its width was calculated by laying down 3 Romans, head to toe; the same space, it was said, could be occupied by 2 & 1/2 Gauls ("Preferrably the half without its head.")

Good episode!

One point that bothered me was that you mentioned that Nicopolis was being besieged by the Goths...but you mentioned Nicomedia on several occasions.

Are they two names for the same city?

I'm really excited about this Thor movie that they are making, Mike. Kenneth Branagh is directing - I didn't realize he was such a big fan of yours. I guess when he saw the hype being generated by The Social Network he knew that your story would be a true blockbuster. He even got Natalie Portman to play Mrs. THoR! I'm not really sure why the production shots have you wearing that strange medieval armor and carrying that big hammer, but I know it will all be explained. I'm not sure that I can wait until 2011!

IIRC, Edward Gibbon made Decius out to be one of the great figures of this time period (or at least thats the idea i gleaned from him) I found this episode very interesting since it gives me another side of what i figured was one of Rome's last, best hopes. Certainly, Decius was one of the last true princeps, it would have been interesting to see what he could have done had he lived.

A belated Congratulations on your marriage, move, winning jersey, and getting picked up by aubible and the cool THOR Tour. Also I was saddened to hear of the passing of your grandfather.  It's always good to have those relationships as long as possible.  He obviously offered you the safe harbour and Rome two very important legacies.
A lot has happened since you embarked upon your quest. Thanks again.
I do have two quick questions:
1. Why when I downloaded the podcasts via iTunes did they load not in numerical order?
2. Is there one place where a booklist you reference in the podcast or recommend through Audible can be found?
Thanks very, very much for hours of excellent entertainment.
ciao from Lotusland:)

Congrats on the marriage, move, and the tour.  I really wish I could come on the tour, but unfortunately, it's going to have to wait a while.  One quick question that could probably go in any comment thread: you said early on the the structure of the legion was one of the main reasons why Rome was able to hold on to power as long as it did.  You also mentioned four phases of the Republican army: barbarian horde, Greek phalanx, maniple system, and finally the Marian cohorts.  Maybe I missed it, but after Marius, did the fundamental structure of the legion ever change again?  And if not, was this a reason why Rome began to stagnate?

alo!
on the programme you made the point a couple of times that the edict of mandatory sacrifices to the gods was or must have been meant against christians...  what about the jews of the empire? were they not numerous enough anymore to need targeting? did they comply, migrate? or were they also rounded up, tortured and murdered?

Mike, I'm feeling that the History Of Rome Podcast is coming towards as end as Rome itself seems on the brink of collapse.  How much I have learned about this once mysterious empire.  Thanks to you, I have a clear and concise understanding of this vast and complex history and am forever grateful to you for doing this work.  Well done.

Thanks so much for the podcast! I love it!

Are you aware that episode 58-84 are missing on iTunes?

I'm stuck at 57 and eager to keep going!

Thanks again!

You mentioned Philip the Arabs brother Guyus as a defacto emperor of the East. What was he doing while his brother was being challenged? What about after he was killed?

I have been following this podcast for several years now.  I am backlogged because of homework, and thus try to listen to podcast at my leisure.

That being said, I wanted to say that I used the analysis of Rome versus Carthage (gleaned primarily from this podcast) in a Church History class at my seminary.  As you mentioned in this podcast, Decius' assault on Christianity led to many Christians renouncing their faith.  Later, some of these Christians were reinstated.  However, this drew the ire of the Christians primarily around the city of Carthage. They formed a schism called Novantism, so named after Antipope Novatian, who held a view that no one who renounced the faith should be readmitted into the church.  The church in Rome held that under its authority and discernment people could be reinstated.

However, I argued in class and still do, that this belief has more to do with regionalism and the interesting dynamic of congregational polity versus episcopate polity.  (Congregational polity puts individual congregations at the forefront of the larger church, whereas the episcopate polite is focused on the church structure rather than the individual churches.)  I believe the Carthaginians used Christianity as a lightning rod against the abuses they felt they suffered under Rome.  Though not a clear link, one can see how congregationalist churches often seek to have a much harder stance towards their faith.  We need only look at the Southern Baptist polity versus say Episcopal Church's polity.

I believe Novantism grew from a major discontent with Rome's bossing around the provinces and, in its own way, was a third front during this trying time in the empire.  While Novantism would disappear, its Christian polity lives on to this day.  It also was a foretaste of the radical freedom being put forth by this sect which appeared to divide the empire at the sake of individual dignity.

Hi,

I want to get my dad to join the THoR gang from the but I would really like the episode numbers to be sorted out if at all possible.  Call me a bluff old traditonalist if you like but could the series not just start at 001 and go up by 001 for every subsequent episode?

I promise to donate 100GBP if this is resolved in Itunes and anywhere else....see, bribery and corruption is always helpful!

Seriously, thanks for a great show!

The way to sort out the episode numbers is to create an ituenes play list and order them yourself:-) the next problem is getting the play list on to your ipod as it doesn't automatically sync podcast playlists.

To do this, connect your ipod and then select it in itunes. Along the top you will see a variety of menu options, one of which is podcast.

Click on pdcast. Then click on History of Rome. At the bottom, you will see a menu option that says "include episodes from playlists". Tick the box and then sync your ipod. Voila!

hope that helps.

I've only just discovered ThoR, and have listened to every episode in less than a fortnight, which is great. However, I missed the 100th episode so didn't get to ask my question - my fault for being late to the party.

So my question would have been; What does Mike think of the games Rome Total War and Rome Total War Barbarian Invasion? Has he seen them?

I have found they enhance my understanding of the ancient world no end, at least in geographical terms. Nothing tells you where Carthage was quicker than taking the city and killing all the occupants.

It also gives a good understanding of tactics. The phalanx versus legion discussion was very interesting, and you can play the battle of Cynocephelae and see the advantage a Roman legion have over a phalanx. However, if defending a fixed position and able to protect the flanks a phalanx is a formidable weapon.

Most of all, the ancient winning strategy of 'stick and pin' becomes clear - to beat an opponent you deny them momentum, get them bogged down in ground or under fire, then you can flank them. I would really recommend them to anyone with an interest in Roman history.

I just finished a book about Roman Generals and in the final chapters on the later Empire it made the claim that "years of making and breaking emperors" had lead to an irreparable lack of discipline. When did the disciplined and elite Roman Legionaire devolve into the undiscipline peasant levies of the medieval era?

Hi Mike, I don't know how much you read the comments, but I'm listening to a really interesting podcast where an author talks about the possibility of environmental burnout (soil degradation, deforestation, etc) contributing to the decline of the Roman Empire.

The book is called "Empires of Food: Feast, Famine, and the Fall of Civilizations"

See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Empires-Food-Feast-Famine-Civilizations/dp/1439101892">http://www.amazon.com/Empires-Food-Feast-Famine-Civilizations/dp/1439101892</a>

Just wanted to say thanks for the podcast. I started listening a couple of months ago and have now finally caught up to the latest one. It's very enjoyable.

I wonder if you can cover something about the technological evolution that happens over the course of the period covered to give an idea of how life was changing (or not) for the people and legions. Was life in the early centuries AD very much the same as when Rome began, or have things progressed a lot since then.

Hi

Just one observation about this episode.  It think that Mike missed an opportunity to get into an interesting subject on the back of this...what was the Arab world in the time of the Romans and what was the relationship between the various Arab kingdoms (such as Nabateans, Ghassanids etc) and Rome?  We have heard of cities such as Palmyra, Petra, Gerasa (Jerash), Bostra, Damascus, Aleppo etc.. how did the culture of the imperial power (Rome) mix with the indiginous semetic cultures and what are the lasting effects of the Roman occupation on the Arab world today...perhaps my questions are too big for this podcast, but this is one area of Roman history that is not well covered in general histories, but  is actually very interesting.  For those that have traveled in the Middle East or Arab World, the foot print of Rome is quite evident throughout the Levant and one even finds a portrait of Philip on Syrian currency!

Also Mike failed to mention the link between Philip and the Severan Dynasty, as his wife Otacilia Severa shows by her name that she came from an Arab family that had been favoured by Septimius Severus.

Another area of interest that was touched on was the early Church in the Arab world.  Mike noted the debate over Philips association with the early church and relative tolerance of Christians.  However there is another interesting thread hear which is...well, what exactly was early Christianity in the Arab world and Near East and how did it spread amongs the Arab/Syrian/Aramean peoples? It is known that Origen (early church father)had close connections with Christian Arabs including the imperial mother, Julia Mamaea ...so  further to the point, what was the connection with Christianity amongst members of the family of Julia Domna, as Syrian who by todays standards...we would consider Arab.

So, for me it would be great if this podcast, as much as I like it, could more often deviate from the history of the Roman Emperors to the history of the Roman Empire and all those over which it ruled...as one of the most interesting aspects of Rome is the sheer diversity of her peoples and the cross fertilization of cultures and ideas that occurred between Rome and the Near East over the course of Rome's dominance over the region.

Hello. I think that single vote was me. I live in Wales and have no interest at all in organized sport and voted out of a generalised sense of obligation towards Mike because of his efforts to educate me and a marginal aesthetic preference for the clean lines of the design. Just to be clear: base-ball is the one with the thin bats that Charlie Brown wasn't any good at and basket-ball is the one with the very tall people from disadvantaged groups?

I encourage all others who enjoy this podcast to do the same. We gotta keep him on the job to finish another couple hundred years of history!
Come on... how about 50 cents for every episode you enjoyed! I'm sure Mike won't mind if you go higher though. I pay more than that for audiobooks at itunes, and they aren't near as entertaining as this!

I took a page from Dan Carlin and put Mike on the buck-a-show program. I enjoy it that much and I probably spend way more money on crap that is no where near as edifying.

After listening to the episodes about hte punic wars and got the explanation why they were called punic and not cartaginian another question struck me.
Since the country of italy did not form until about the 1800s what did the romans call their home peninsula. Did they call it italy or  did they call it something else?
Just curious.

A recurring theme is "The Legions" seizing power on their own, or declaring a general to be emperor.

I was hoping you could explain why/how Rome kept letting this happen. I assume the legions needed new recruits sent their way on a frequent bases, so why didn't Rome use these new recruits to form new legions which were loyal to the Senate?

Im an American and have been living here for about 10 years, if i can help you with anything related to the tour or if you have any other needs from Rome, photos, museum catalog's, contacts, etc. I couldn't find your email address, but I imagine you will have access to mine on this site. Do let me know if I can be of any help and thanks again for helping me understand the city I'm living in.

You do an amazing job and have instilled in me a thirst for knowledge in Roman History that can not be quenched.

Keep up the great work and like everyone else, hope to see this continue through the Eastern Empire.

There was an interesting dark ages period at my house where I had only up to Germanicus and I couldn't even listen to that one.  I listened and relistened to the 10 episodes on my mp3 player as I walked and or sorted mail. Dark times indeed.
Well yes as I also just decided to get my first credit card as soon as it is set-up I'll use it to make my first transaction as a payment for your excellent podcasts.

Amazing that Timesitheus was born in 190 BC and yet was still alive to mentor Gordian III in the 3rd Century AD!

(I did a double take when I heard Mike misspeak that birth year...)

Baseball? Is that the pastime where men with very large gluteus maximuses attampo, mostly unsuccessfully, to hit a ball with a stick whilst chewing tobacco or gum and expectorating as frequently as possible (especially when the camera is on them)?

Sorry, I was too late.  I think the only improvement would be if the pants go down to the ankles (stirrup style), then you must remove the rear pocket and move the zipper to the back.  If the pants stop at just below the knee and have over socks that pull up high, then the player probably has a wallet and needs a back pocket and a zipper in front.   I mean what the hell is Bowie Kuhn thinking?

Hello All,
I'm up to this part in Gibbon and Herodian, it's actually very exciting, the story of power, corruption, love, hate, envy, suspicion, betrayal, murder and intrigue...who needs modern soap opera? Even the daily news pales against the tension of these dramas in history. As we're listening to the decline phase, I notice the tactics of the usurpers seems to get more and more desparate and the good men get squeezed out with more brutality, if that is even possible.
Keeping us all breathless with excitement, as usual!

Something funky is going on with the audio too.

At 0:27 - 0:35 and 1:57 - 2:14 it cuts out and (the) mike sounds really tinny and distant. I'm only those few minutes into the episode and it's happened twice. Maybe it's just my download but it's never happened before.

Dear Mike,
Discovered your podcasts by accident and am now hooked.  The great JC  (that is Gaius Julius Caesar) has just become Proconsul so I have many more episodes to enjoy. Thankyou for your incisive, witty broadcasts. Who said history had to be boring? When you have the time - and/or the inclination, Ancient Greek history cries out for your deft handling as well!

Dear Mike
yes there have been other history podcasts, even one about the city I currently live in (Istanbul, ehem Byzanz, ehem Constantinople), but your very endearing and humorous way of guiding us through history means you are clearly the Emperor of emperors in the realm of history podcasts...
Once your tour ends in İstanbul, it would be nice to catch up with you all on my doorstep so to speak

Best wishes

Axel, Istanbul

Instead of worrying about the Byzantines, a handful of episodes going over what happened in the west after Romulus Augustulus would be cool.  Transitions are always interesting.

That century afterwards with King Theodoric as the King of the Romans in Italy, and the rise of the Franks.  It's interesting stuff how the Europe changed in that time.

Hello,

Many thanks for an excellent podcast. It has been a trusted companion for many miles during my regular runs.

I thought you might be interested in this story from Discovery about a Roman charioteer that probably was the highest paid athlete in history. <a href="http://news.discovery.com/history/roman-charioteers-athletes.html">http://news.discovery.com/history/roman-charioteers-athletes.html</a>

I've a question. In this podcast you mention that Gordian the First was in the provincial capital of Carthage.

What, what, what?!

When, and why, did the Romans allow Carthage to be rebuilt? Didn't they level that city to the ground and sow the land with salt so that no one could ever live there again? What gives?

Just love all the intrigue in this episode and the last few episodes, altough sometime you could see the betrayel coming from a mile away and it keeps you wondering what they were doing, or in on of the last episodes i still can't understand why that guy thought up all the strategy and then just forgets to attack, the could finally be rid of their lifelong enemies. but yeah,
dan white:Carthage was indeed paved to the ground but unlikely couvered in salt>. way to valuable, however caesar augustus ( the adopted one by juliar caesar) rebuilt it, it was originally caesars idea. It got the same name again. In the ens after the vadals conquer it belasaurius the great general of the byzantine empire conquers it, afterwards it just fadesin history and Tunis was built just a few miles next to it

BTw great podcast, i love roman history, to bad i can't join the tour, btw there is a podcast about the byzantyne empire and their most important rulers... it's not a complete story though...

I have listened to all of them and I really like this episode.  Most casual Roman histories fudge the 50 years between the Severans and Diocletian.  This fills in the blanks nicely.  I especially like the part where you discuss Maximinius plan to kill the Senate, the whole disgusting lot of them.  Sometimes history is a bit to clinical and this sort of thing peps it up.

philosophers and storytellers, not to argue, but to grope for commonality at the far reaches of their belief systems. The original dialogues, convened by Bohm and Leroy Little Bear (former director of Native Studies at Harvard) in Kalamazoo, Michadf., in 1992, came about because Little Bear, who was well-versed in the developments of quantum physics, realized that Western science had reached the end of linear thought and finally got it: The universe is a living, conscious, interconnected organism.

Hi Mike
The tour looks great and I really want to go. You look like you put a lot of effort into it and I don't want to take anything away from that. But Is there anything that can be done if you don't live in the US, or at least North America. Aka the UK (or for those in other parts of europe and the world), like not paying for the flight for New York or (but this is a bit of a dream) but a flight from the UK (maybe having your plane stop in the UK and pick us up :)an even bigger dream). Anyway what ever happens I'm going to looking around that situation so I can go. Thanks for the organisation of this trip and a brilliant podcast

To @Simon C
I don't think Mike know's, cause from what he's said (especally in the 100th episode) he dosn't make predictions anymore.

This trip sounds amazing, and I'm definitely interested. I doubt I can drag any of my friends along for the ride though, and I'd rather not pay the single supplement if I can help it on a student's salary, so hopefully there's a likeminded THoR fanatic out there to travel with.

You guys have probably already thought of this but it would be great if the yet-unveiled forum had a thread for fellow fans to coordinate travelling plans.

Thanks for putting in the tremendous effort into both the trip and the weekly podcast!

Mike,

Thank you for all your work: THOR podcast. They should rise a statue for you in Rome. The "history of rome tour" is super but i think it is to much in such a little time. I'v been three times in Rome for holiday and still haven't seen enough. There is to much to see. The same for Pompei.

For the the "history of rome tour" part II in 2012 I can advise a visit to the former town Colonia Ulpia Traiana, modern day Xanten in Germany, at the border of the roman empire. Visit <a href="http://xanten.afg.hs-anhalt.de/desk30.html">http://xanten.afg.hs-anhalt.de/desk30.html</a> to get information about this site.

Ciao, Johan Koning

I don't know if this is the appropriate spot to place this comment, but I am wildly appreciative of this podcast.  My nephew put me onto it about a month ago and I am already to episode 72.
Mike, thank you so much for your efforts here: what a blessing.  As a Roman Catholic priest, I have not found a better historical source than yours.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart and, for whatever this is worth to you, I ask God to bless and keep you and your family in His care...

Mike,
I just got to the episode where you have announced "The Tour". Great idea and I'm working on my wife to let me join the second tour.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the Podcasts on such a fascinating topic, but as an engineer I am struck by something that has always puzzled me. Where were the great schools of engineering (the MITs and Cal Techs) in ancient Rome? Where did the engineers and architects acquire such astonishing knowledge? Why did Filippo Brunelleschi in the 14th century, spend years studying the remains of Roman buildings (by now Rome was a ghost town of 30,000 people and basically had become a gigantic builders supply yard) in order to figure out how to build the Duomo in Florence?

Spent three days in area and two full days visiting the park and memorials were not enough. Should have had a third. Used dardanel troy Cannakale as a base and left car at Kilitbahir. Our visit was focussed on the British landings in the Cape Hellas area and Morto Bay as well as Gully Ravine. There was more than enough to see with British, French and Turkish sites. It is a must to read up on the Gallipoli campaign before you go. Pretty spectacular and difficult terrain was dwarfed by a second visiting Suvla and Anzac areas www.privatetoursinistanbul.com Spectacularly beautiful and daunting/terrible for those who fought there. September is a quiet time for a visit with good weather although very dry. Well worth the visit Thank you all so much.

I'm not sure if it was this episode that you introduced the Sassanids, but when you mentioned their region of origin, you said Saudi Arabia bordered it on the southwest.

Of course, Saudi Arabia is an anachronism, as it is creation of the British Empire in the early 20th century.

The proper geographical term might have been the Arabian Peninsula.

Maybe you can upload a map or put a link to show the region of origin of the Sassanids?

Another great show mike! The History of Rome tour? Sounds awesome! For all my fellow ancient history fans, I've found something really good. The Apple iBookstore, which you can use if you have an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad, and maybe other things, i'm not sure, has the full 6 volume set of "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" by Edward Gibbon, for free! It also has ancient historys, like Suetonius's Twelve Caesars. Hope you all enjoy :)

Seeing Rome through your eyes would be quite an experience.  Sign me up!

For those of us that live in Europe, it probably would be best if you could make any airplane tickets for the trip optional.

It would be really cool if you would put up a few maps with sites so that we could all do our own reading about them before we go.

I will keep following the podcast, although somehow the decline of Rome makes me feel sad and not as enthusiastic about it as the rise :-(

I am going to Rome next September for the third time; have to go regularly :-) would love to join in May 20111, consider me highly interested!

I would be HIGHLY interested in the Rome tour, eagerly waiting for information on this one.

In regards to the episode, Alexander is one of my favorite emperors, he is probably the last emperor when the empire as a whole can be described as "prospering".

Also, i don't think Alexander can be called the last princeps, there were certainnly others after him. Im not sure who exactly was the last one, perhaps Tacitus (275-276)? I do know that the princeps didn't "officially" die until Diocletian.

Agree with Sebeil above; there have been several bummer emperors in a row. I'm missing me some Julio-Claudians right about now.

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History (the one with the wicked 3-episode series on the Punic Wars) just did a 1.5 hr show on the the transition of the republic into an empire.

We need some sort of sign-up for the tour NOW so no one gets left out! Will it be short, Mike, like a week (easier for people to work into their schedules)?

I'd love to be on the tour, but as someone else mentioned, we're not all Stateside. If there was a "flightless" package organised that would be ideal, since I'd be preferably flying from Ireland!

The Roman tour sounds pretty awesome.  I hope it will not just be Rome - but it would be pretty sweet to visit some of the provinces.  8 years ago I toured a bunch of Roman cities in Wales, England, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany and Switzerland.  It would be nice to see the other parts of the empire as well.

I am definitely interested in going back though - even if it is just Rome.

Mike... going to Rome... Europe in general! is a huge part of my dream to travel around the world. This tour is an amazing idea, and a beacon of hope as I enter junior year next year in High School.

However, I'm concerned that at in May, I'll still be at school and it might hamper with my schoolwork and grades. Is it possible to reschedule to summer? I would think that it's more logical in a way because more students and more people will have a lot more free time during summer.

Thanks anyway Mike, and I'll probably go on tour anyway even if it's on May.

I've been wondering....how did the Romans communicate with the people from different parts of the empire?

For example, recall the captured tribal chief from Britain who save his life by his eloquent appeal to the Roman senate. I don't imagine he learned Latin well enough to give auch an impressive speech. It's also doubtful that the Roman senators spoke English, or whatever language this captive spoke.

Greetings all,

About the History of Rome tour.
I just want to remind everyone that there are tons and tons of excellent 'Roman' sites which are not in the city of Rome or even in Italy.
I had gotten my fair share of amphitheaters, battle fields, walls and ruins years before I ever set foot in Rome proper.
Germany, Croatia, Swiss, Spain, France (etc) all have excellent sites which are well worth the detour.


and Mike-love the podcast

After listening to your podcasts, I would so love to see a tv series about the Severans they way 'Rome' and 'I, Claudius' cover the last days of the Republic and early days of the empire. Julia Maesa seems perhaps to fit the mold of Robert Graves Livia more than the historical Livia does.

The rains really don't depart until late September or early October. Sometimes it stays longer.
That's why I remember standing in the rain and feeling (and smelling) like a wet dog during the days Don Shula and Jimmy Johnson were the Dolphins coaches -- because both coaches forced their teams to practice in the elements. And the media had to stand there and watch.
Shula would contend practicing in the rain would prepare his teasdfms for dealing with the rain when it came down during the regular season. Johnson believed the practices in the rain toughened up his team.

Hey long time fan...just have a question about this episode..

Everything I have heard about Elagabalus dwells about the more bizarre aspects of his behavior. The gender identity issue, his stab at prostituiton etc. How come you didn't at least mention that? I don't mean in graphic detail, but every other source on the boy emperor writes more about that than anything else. Was it to keep "Clean" status?

I still had it in my craw about Mike recommending Howard Zinn's book "A People's History of the United States" a while back. I said my piece at the time, but just found new information . His recently released FBI and KGB file shows him to have been a long-time communist, a supporter of Stalin and of Hitler. Zinn was man with an agenda with nothing good to say about the USA. Here is the link, which is more proof than he ever gave in his so-called history book: <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/howard_zinns_dupes.html">http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/08/howard_zinns_dupes.html</a>

Brent, no offense taken, this is a  wonderful podcast, I agree. If I had read Eric's comments from last week I may not have made mine, as he made my points very well. I too lament that Zinn is mentioned, and have not mentioned him for a long time, having moved on. But the new info is quite explosive and needs to be anywhere that there are those who would defend him.

Zinn was in the communist party, which took it's lead from Stalin. When Stalin was allied with Hitler, so was the party in America. When Hitler stabbed the soviets in the back, the CPUSA turned against him. It is laid out well in the article I linked to above.

I chuckled to myself on the bus, about the painting of the weirdo new Emperor, hanging on the Senate wall. I got some strangle looks.
The History of Rome is so much a part of my leisure time now, that its end will be a very sad time for me.
Mike should be very highly praised for this most entertaining and informative series.

If past is prologue, by October, Sink and her Republican opponent (McCollum or Scott) will be eviscerating each other in television commercials and engaging in some of the very negative politicking her ad seems to decry. The reason: negative campaigning works. Just ask McCollum and Scott.

Like McCollum and Scott, Sink will be demanding that she and her opponent "debate the issues" and talk about what's really important to Florida. But, as the Republicans did in this primary, chances are high that Sink and her Republican opponent will only agree to a paltry number of debates (4 or fewer), which will leave little time to fully discuss and vet the issues because the forums (fora?) will be structured around television rules. What probably won't happen: A meaningful exchange on a topic that lasts more than five minutes, a back-and-forth where the candidateasdfs will actually have to debate each other and defend their positions under questioning.

Hello Mike,
I would just like to thank you soooo much for doing the history of Rome. Up until now all I ever knew of Rome were just basic stories and little fact. Now I know so much more. Your time and effort into making this clearly shows. Thank you very much.

Question:  You were lamenting that the podcast has become a bit of a history of Rome's emperors.  I've also noticed this, and I suppose that it is to some degree unavoidable, but I have a suggestion to add some non-emperor, political, military content.  To wit: can you put on a podcast regarding Roman technological advancements?  What types of things did Roman society invent, adopt and popularize?  Regarding these advancements, when did they occur.  Was Roman technological life different in say 200 a.d. relative to 50 b.c.?  To the extent that the semi-schooled have ideas about what the Romans accomplished in terms of advancements, we think of roads and acqeducts, but sort of assume that these things cropped up before the time of Caesar and were more or less frozen in place until the empire collapsed centuries afterward.  I am curious about general advancements in infrastructure, agriculture, mettalurgy, military science and the like.  Just throwing it out there.

By the way, as a Zin fan, you may be interested in some extremely unflattering info about the man that was recently released:

<a href="http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/zinn_howard.htm">http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/zinn_howard.htm</a>

Relatedly, I found your podcast on the stratification of Roman society to be simplistic, probably because of the Marxist orientation.  I understand that you had a very wealthy head of the empire and some pretty darn wealthy guys just below.  From there you seem to be saying that we had millions of destitute masses, living as little more than beggars.  When I visited the ruins at Pompei, I saw what seemed like the remnants of a wealthy merchantile zone.  Presumably, this orderly zone had to have been supported by a mass of cash paying customers who had at least some money to rub together.  I guess what I'm wondering is whether you vastly oversimplified what life was like for non-senators.  I wouldn't trade places with a plebe, but I'm skeptical that once you got past the senatorial class, you had millions living lives of desperate penury.

@Eric F - One gets the idea as Republic shifts to Empire that Wealth, Power and Land become increasingly centralised in the hands of a few, that become an even fewer still. That is to say that the roots of medieval feudalism are to be found in late Roman Latifundia, gigantic estates worked for a noble figure at the top who owned almost everything while the individual workers were free only in name.

As for a "marxist reading of history" well, sorry if the truth hurts, but there were a lot of class conflicts in Roman history. Remember the Gracchus brothers? Not everything was always hunky dory with the Pleb masses.

Andres, I am not asserting that life was grand for the plebes, not at all.  I was merely commenting to the effect that there was likely much more to Roman society than a tiny, tiny fraction of wealthy and an overwhelming percentage of the utterly destitute.  As for "class conflicts": what would that term explain?  The History of Rome seems to think it helps to explain the rise of Christianity.  Seems plausible, although on a VERY delayed timeline.  Does it explain the eventual success of the barbarians?  I don't see how that fits.  Was there really any system that could  disperse wealth in an ancient world with such a relatively small amount of aggregate wealth in the first place?  Beats me.  This was a worls without aggregations of capital, without name brands and chain stores and huge manufacturing facilities.  Every last bit of the place was small scale compared even relative to England circa 1700.  I think it's a challenge to graft a Marxist analysis on every last societal structure throughout history.  It strikes me as the equivalent of analyzing an ant colony or a beehive through a Marxist prism.  Marx was wrong about 1800, and he is if anything even more wrong about 180.

@Eric F - Good idea that about the technological advancements within the Roman world. There was a wealth of very advanced engineering knowledge that was obviously present within the Roman world, but was then lost for 1,500 odd years until even the present day. Including, but not limited to, water-proof mortars for reservoirs, specialist concretes (think Pantheon dome), an understanding of flow rate within aqueducts, subsidence within building foundations, load-bearing arches, bridges... the list goes on. The question I've always wondered is where was this knowledge was stored, and how was it disseminated? What there an M.I.T. of the ancient world somewhere in Rome?

Eric — regarding Howard Zinn...what information about him did you find unflattering?  I realize there are over 400 pages in the FBI file to slog through, I'm just wondering where in those pages (many seem to concern changes of address only) you found the unflattering bits.   Any hints?  In the 30 or so pages I've read my take-away is that it's unflattering to the FBI — they sure wasted a lot of taxpayer money — but nothing new about Zinn.

The History of Rome has a Marxist orientation?  Wha???  That seems like a stretch to me, but maybe I missed something.  Could you enlighten me?  Maybe the FBI should open on a file on Mike.

Finally, I'm also curious about the evolution of technology over the history of the empire.  Just a guess, but I bet the availability of slave labor put a damper on innovation, at least "down on the farm."  On the other hand, the many wars and culture clashes probably led to advancements.  Certainly in the field of medicine if nothing else.  And have you checked out the Antikythera mechanism?  Whoa! My guess is that the MIT of the ancient world was in Greece, and the CalTech was in Egypt (or India...or China).

The info on Zinn may not be new to Zinn experts, but it looked new to me.  Among the stuff provided under the FOIA request is that he was active in the communist party at a time when Stalin was running the show in the USSR.  I find that nauseating, but maybe I'm just behind the times.  I grew up during teh cold war days and the drum beat of propaganda as to how wonderful things were behind the iron curtain was absolutely astounding.  And the jerks who made these claims never gave an apology or accounting after the wall came down.  There's still 15% or so of the country that will talk to you for as long as you let them about how wonderful things are in Cuba.

I think in this day and age it's more likely that the FBI would keep a file on you if you are NOT sufficiently left wing...

I love Mike's podcast and have learned an absolute ton about Rome from them.  That said, when he mentioned his affinity for Zinn, I noticed that Zinn's orientation of "class struggle" as explanation for everything influenced a few of his discussions on the organization of Roman society.  It's a point of view that I just don't find persuasive.

On technology: Mike has discussed advancements in Roman military tactics (i.e., the two part discussion, "a phalanx with wings" -- although I never did understand why the other guys couldn't just copy that...), but not so much in other areas.  I don't know much about the topic and would love to hear more, and again a picture of how things changed over the course of the empire's duration.  If I can add another point, the Roman alphabet was different than other written communication systems.  Was this advantageous?  When was the final form of the alphabet crystalized?  Did it matter because much of the population was not literate anyway?

Well Eric ownership of land was the basis of wealth in agricultural societies.  With the overwhelming control of land and slave labour by a select few (and it is obvious why that would be so from a market point of view...big farms are more efficient than small ones) there was an overwhelming problem with mass poverty in the Empire.  It was a problem they never really beyond free games and the grain dole.

There were things like mercantile trade BUT since the costs of transport prior to rail-roads were enormous so you were really only importing luxury goods to sell to the rich since nothing else would be profitable.  That makes for a rather small market to sell to and a low number of people holding jobs like that.  All this was well known and discussed before Marx was even born.

But you can see those factors at play all over the pre-industrial world.  We never really had to deal with those dynamics as much here in the United States because land was so plentiful and then the Industrial Revolution broke out.

Oh and can we please keep any conspiracy theories about the FBI out of this?  Fels was just making a joke.

"Well Eric ownership of land was the basis of wealth in agricultural societies."

I don't see that as being a descriptive statement.  Were there any non-agricultural socities in the western world at this time?  Why would Rome have a different poverty problem than the Germans or the Parthians?

"Big farms are more efficient than small ones)"

I doubt that was the case back then once you reach a relatively small level of scale.  It wasn't as if you had mechanized operations that could usefully take on thousands of acres.  Nowadays, there is a clear advantage in applying a tractor over 1,000 acres and not 10, but that's much less clear cut when you are using an ox. The family farm even in this country wasn't truly dead and buried until less than a century ago.

"There were things like mercantile trade BUT since the costs of transport prior to rail-roads were enormous so you were really only importing luxury goods to sell to the rich since nothing else would be profitable. That makes for a rather small market to sell to and a low number of people holding jobs like that."

I understood the wealth of Britian, for example, was in timber and other more mass-consumables.  I don't doubt that there was big bucks to be made in moving light objects salable at a huge mark-up, but I don't think the empire's strength was based on moving around baubles for a few people.

Further, Gibbon discusses at length how the barbarians marveled at the prosperity they saw in the Roman lands as they were plucking them clean.  Did this somewhat higher tide only raise a few boats, or were the people generally better off?  Presumably the people were indeed better off, presumably something societally worthwhile was lost when Rome disintegrated.  Otherwise, the fall of Rome is really the slow burning fuse of the liberation of millions of slaves from an emperor and senatorial class.  That's not really the story, is it?

All that said, I'm perfectly willing to stipulate that I would NOT want to be a plebe!

Was there any kind of coronation or investiture ceremony for the Emperors?  I'm guessing that, if there was, it was considered optional, since some of them never went to Rome.  If not, was there anything that was considered a definitive, "He is NOW the Official & Legal Emperor" indicator?

Mike - Thank you very much for THoR...awesome podcast!  I started listening late and just caught up through the 100th episode.  You mentioned the possibility of someday writing a book.  That someday should be now.  Don't wait until you have finished recounting all of Rome's history.

I have experience writing a book  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintaining-Data-Warehouse-Silvers/dp/1420064622/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280973366&sr=1-1).">http://www.amazon.com/Building-Maintaining-Data-Warehouse-Silvers/dp/1420064622/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280973366&sr=1-1).</a>  The surprise is that at first you don't write a book. Instead, you write a book proposal.  This is the book that helped me write my book proposal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nonfiction-Proposals-Anybody-Revised-Updated/dp/039952827X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280973515&sr=1-4).">http://www.amazon.com/Nonfiction-Proposals-Anybody-Revised-Updated/dp/039952827X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280973515&sr=1-4).</a>

Right now you have the A#1 ticket to getting a book published - an audience; and, you have the A#2 ticket - a popular topic.  Your writing is on the same par as David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose - precise, accurate and accessible.  Anyway, please consider writing and publishing a book on THoR.

Thank you.

I love this cast, but after 100 episodes I still have to struggle with the pronunciation of some names... as a Romance language native speaker "CURR-AH-cula" doesn't sound anywhere close to "Caracalla" to me! The same for "PAR-RHUN-ees" a couple of episodes back... turns out it was meant to be "Perennis"... Mike's Latin is very sui generis... no pun intended.

Here's something of help:

Without question the material condition of Roman society at nearly all levels was far higher than that of the barbarians.   There is a revisionist school of history that argues that the barbarian cultures were actually advanced civilizations, despite their illiteracy and inability to build or create anything permanent.  This is unpersuasive, to put it mildly.

If you want to get a feel for what life was like in the second century, a great place to start is Jerome Carcopino's classic "Daily Life in Ancient Rome.". Superb scholarship written so that it is easily accessible to the general reader.

I'd like to ask, does one great civilization's inventions and advancements naturally develop in isolation, without the influences from other groups? Though doubtlessly, there were in Rome, inventors and men with original ideas, as the Empire expanded the incorporated folk would surely have added to the collective understanding of how the world works, ideas absorbed and improved on by those Romans with the luxury of time to spend on a given problem, not just fighting for basic subsistence. I'm guessing technology flows between communities, like food influences, language and religious practices. The clincher is having individuals in a society with enough wealth (time and money) to devote their attentions to technology.

Hello Good People,

The distribution of wealth tends to follow a mathematical distribution. This is commonly known as the 80/20 rule. It is also the known as the Zipf distribution.

The distribution of wealth tends to follow the same pattern regardless of government or epoch. It is a very long drop from the one to at the top to the next one down. This drop continues a few ranks and then very quickly levels out for a slow decline that is nearly imperceptible.

The only real question is do the people at the start of the slow decline have enough to "get by"? If they do, they you have a comfortable civilisation. If you don't then times are hard. Regardless, these bottom masses do not hold much of the aggregate wealth.

I make no assertions as to the cause of this distribution. As far as the communist/capitalist struggle goes, I don't have a dog in the fight. I am merely describing the results.

In response to Agustin's post about Mike's suspect pronunciation of names et all, I don't think Mike is particularly guilty of any crime. Since we can easily access a more detailed account of any given event if we so wish, Mike's Podcasts must be praised as being responsible for an easy to digest introduction, to what could ordinarily be a very laborious undertaking.
I've had a long fascination with ancient Rome, and take Mike's series to be well written and superbly delivered entertainment, rather than a detailed and definitive account.
In Dan Carlin's "Hardcore History" series, Dan himself always informs the listener he is simply a "fan of history" rather than the fount of all knowledge, so he can have a little more license with his delivery - albeit brilliantly realised - and is able to challenge the listener a little more, by the very fact that he bends a few rules of convention.
I think Mike should be forgiven for any slight embellishments, funny insights and certainly for pronunciation errors, as the thing is such compelling listening.

Now on my 110th episode, I have to weigh in.  Quoting Dwight K. Shrute to explain the loyalty of the Praetorian Guard is truly inspirid.  Really, really, brilliant.    There are times I have found this pod too sardonic; other times I thought "why does he sound like Vinnie Barbarino from Welcome Back Kotter everytime he pronounces Marc Aunt-Knee?  It's madding!"

But these are small quibbles.  The pleasure derived from the vast amount of information assimilated here is considerable, and Mike Duncan has done history buffs a great service pulling it all together.  Only a real love of the topic could keep someone slogging through the demands this enterprise imposes.  Congratulations and many, many thanks.  Very well done.

Caracalla did manage to do one thing positive. He granted full citizenship to all free Roman subjects all over the empire! Do you think he did this out of the kindness of his heart or was it to increase the number of tax-paying citizens to pay for his army? Also, do you think it helped or hurt the empire in the long term?

Mr. Duncan,

Love your podcast, really love listening to it in my down time.  I did find a small error; you said both sons of Severus were declared Augustus by the legions following his death, but the plural of second declension nouns in that case end with i instead of us, making it Augusti.  Thank you again for the hours of enjoyment.

Sincerely,

Andrew

Mike - we all know that Diocletian is just beyond the horizon.

I love these pod casts and have listened to them all throughout their entirety, no less than 4 times...

But, I think that I can speak for all when I say that we want your absolute best for then man who instituted the tetrarchy...

He was hands down the best Roman Emperor... There is not a need to argue - Diocletian instituted bold and remarkable reforms that the empire desperately needed. And, he ultimately gave it all up to retire... His story is way better than the other top two contenders for best roman emperor...

Augustus: OK, good but old and he road Caesar's coattails....

Trajan: For sure the paradigm of a great emperor. However, he ruled into a period in which was already stable; his method of ruling was awesome, and it allowed the empire to stay in peace and prosperity.

Who else can claim so much as Diocletian? He is the best...

Thanks!

LOl! Just read the comment above and all I can say is it's totally a matter of how you yourself relate to the history to name the best emperor.
I personally am a big fan of Vespasian and think of him as the man who saved Rome.
The point though is they were all men of their time and Rome woundn't have been the template for western civilisation without these men of outstanding charactor and fortitude.
However Vespasian built the most recognisable building in ancient Rome which rivals the pryimids and the partheon as a testimate to the power of the ancients, the coliseum.
Not bad for a 'muliteer'
Great General, Great Emperor and Great man!

Minor correction for you: the Severan Wall was not Hadrian's Wall, but the Antonine Wall which is North of Hadrian's Wall, originally built by Antoninus Pius 20 years after the more famous wall.

Marco, I agree that Vespasian was a great man and a great emperor but the Flavian Amphitheatre is the Colosseum. The Coliseum is a theatre in London, with which Veapasian had no connection. The adjective is intended to indicate that the building is colossal not colisal. Jim.

In this episode you say "One of the sons of @Mike: Minor nit to pick here. Pertinax would actually find himself executed around this time after punning on one of the names for the Goths, suggesting that Caracalla should also award himself the name Getacus (sp?) as well." However, in episode 109, you discuss the origins of the Goths, saying that they first appear in the Roman records in about 238 A.D., 27 years after the events in this episode. Was Getacus really a pun on the "Goths", but under a different name? Or is there some confusion in the records?

BTW, I'm a huge fan of the podcast, currently on my *second* time through the series.

This doesn't relate to this particular episode, but it was suggested that the blog was a better place to bring this question to Mike than the Forum Gallorum.

I was browsing through the iphone app store looking at history apps, and I was surprised to see a THoR app, since I didn't recall Mike mentioning it on the podcast. I was made suspicious when I didn't see Mike's name appearing anywhere in the text. It's released by something called Wizzard media. Is this legit? I'm asking because they're charging $1.99 for the app, and I'm hoping that money goes to Mike to support the podcast, and not to someone cashing in on his work. (the sample screen grabs show a list of some podcast numbers and titles, and it's definitely THoR and not something similar.)

If it's legit, I'll pay the $2 to support the podcast, but if it's not, I thought MIke should at least be aware of it, and can decide what if anything he wants to do from there.

I am blessed to have the opportunity to be in Rome for about a week or so in mid-October.  I will spend most of my time visiting the landmarks I have learned so much about thanks to you.

If there are any pictures I can take or any info I can gather that will aid your efforts, post it here.

I am a long-time history buff with an MA in history (a bit more recent history), and I thank you for helping to open a whole new period of interest for me.

Thanks in large part to your podcasts, I am now obsessed with all things Roman.

With many thanks and the best of wishes,

Did we get the word "Severe" from this emperor?
Or was he named so because of his hard attitude?
Or is there no relationship between the two?

I've wondered this same thing too Mike.  Do our modern english words like severe (latin: severus) and crass (latin: crassus) get their modern definition from the characteristics displayed by those famous romans who were known by these names?  I mean, if Pompey was anything, he was pompous.

Funnily enough I was wondering whether severe comes from Severus. Taken from an online dictionary:
Severe:

Still doesn't fully answer the question, but it can be inferred.

Also found this.
<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=severity">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=severity</a>

severity
late 15c., "austerity or strictness of life," from M.Fr. severite, from L. severitas, from severus "stern, strict, serious," possibly from *se vero "without kindness," from se "without" (see secret) + *vero "kindness," neuter ablative of verus "true" (see very). Meaning "strictness in dealing with others" is recorded from 1520s.

I love the history of Rome podcast, cooking dinner on a Monday wouldn't be the same without it!

Just noticed that Amazon use the same music in their  kindle demonstration video.

All the best and keep up the good work.

Channel 4, the british broadcaster, has a documentary all about Septimius Severus' invaision of Britain: 'The Untold Invaision of Britain'.  It is available to watch again on 4OD on the Internet here in the UK, maybe people can get it overseas.  It's enjoyable if a bit '300'ish in the reconstructions.

I may be stating a fact that most of you already know here, but should anyone who doesn't already know the works of Lars Brownworth, seek to gain more knowledge on the later pariod of the empire, then read on.
As Mike moves ever onward - yet has stated he may not go much further - I have found the lectures by Lars to be very good. He has a similar easy pace of delivery to Mike, and the articles are very well done.
Check the Byzantine Emperors items at:

Helen was right about the Channel 4 show 'The Untold Invasion Of Britain'. Well worth a look if you get the chance.
And Steve is right on the money with Lars Brownworth, '12 Bizantine Rulers', although I would still like to see that period given the Mike Duncan treatment, unlikely though it may be.

Tom: don't make Mike self-conscious about the intro music! He sounded kinda like he didn't like it that much in Episode 100, but I always thought of it as very Roman-y until he let on it was just Garage Band stock or whatever.

Wicked Chicken: Hardcore History has 3 episodes (like an hour or 1.5h each!) about the Punic Wars, and they are amazing. Dan Carlin is a compelling speaker, really painting a picture for the listener, and the story is chilling. A MUST DOWNLOAD for THoR fans!

For those interested in the religious life of the Romans and other Mediterranean peoples, iTunes has a "Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean" podcast. Episodes 4.1- 4.6 deal with the gods of Rome. Other episodes comment on Hebrew and Christian events. The creator of this has other web sites, one looks to be dedicated to food in the Greco-Roman world. Have yet to explore it further.
Thanks for posting episode 28 again, it downloaded successfully to join the others.

I'm not sure if anyone has answered this, but I noticed that several of you were wondering about the etymology of Severus and I thought I'd provide my two cents.

In the "classical" Latin (or variously, "lingua Latina", "Latinitas", "sermo urbanus") of the late Roman Republic and the Empire, "Severus" was an adjective that meant "strict", "stern"; "severe", "austere"; "grim", "terrible".  "Severe" was an adverb that meant "sternly", "severely". Lastly, "severitas" (-atis) meant "strictness" or "austerity".

That the term was employed during the Republic means that it predated Severus.  I write that because as I referenced my materials, I initially wondered if Severus' father disliked him by naming him "stern" or "austere" or if the word was introduced during/after Severus' reign.  Cassius Dio doesn't seem to indicate anything etymological about the name either.

Anyway, that's my take.

I wonder how long it would take to get a degree in history and what you could do with it afterwords. What level of mastery does a successful career as a historian require?

Hmm, it seems to me that choosing the best and brightest to make up the Praetorian Guard is just good common sense. Especially since the last crop of guards were all self-serving opportunists. I would think that quadrupling the size of the Guard (in addition to skimming the top of the talent pool) was probably the problematic issue. 4,000 talented individuals is likely somewhat a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the legions overall, but 16,000 talented individuals probably starts to be significant. Just my musings, but I'd submit them for consideration.

Are all of the provincial governors who were hailed as imperator by their troops included by historians as part of the "Year of the Five Emperors?" Because it seems to me that after Pertinax, old Severus pretty much had things well in hand. Silly historians. Probably just trying to sell books.

Just as a matter of interest - was there any major underlying political difference between the Praetorian Guard and the Urban Cohorts? Was one more or less loyal to the emperor/senate/plebs than the other? [Obviously aside from Didius Julianus].

@Jeremy,

The problem with using your best soldiers for guard duty is that the fronts tend to suffer more.

When I play Rome: Total War, I garrison my cities with cheap Town Watch and use my best units to crush my rivals and expand the frontier. You don't get to Urban Cohorts and Praetorian Guard until later in the game. That last thing you want to use those elite units for is guarding your inner cities.

It would be as if we tried to use Navy Seals and Special Forces to police Washington D.C rather having him on them deployed to a war zone.

@Guy,

I think that while it probably doesn't help to use your best soldiers to garrison the city and protect you, Severus lived in a period when people only wanted power regardless of stability.

He had just become emperor by declaring that he was, and marching his legions to rome. There was no legitimacy in that kind of power grab, and any general witth half an army would have no reason not ti make a power grab. Remember, he had also not finished his war as he still had to face Pescennius Niger.

His position in rome was not safe, and having a guard that was 4 times larger that the previous and entirely composed of loyal, elite soldiers was one of the few ways he could dissuade opposition. Julius Caesar accomplished much with 15,000 hardened veterans.


I also want to ask Mike (or anyone here who has an idea) a Question. I was looking at the names of the emperors from septimius severus onto his children and beyond, and it seems that after ascension, they took the name of a previous emperor who hadn't adopted them, like Pertinax being used by Sep. Sev., Antoninus Pius being used also, and most frequently Marcus Aurelius. Why was this done? I've tried-and failed- to come up with a suitable explanantion.

I guess to clarify what I was trying to say, I don't think it was so much that the front was losing valuable talent as much as the fact that Severus suddenly quadrupled the amount of talent that he was pulling off his front-lines.

If each centuria lost one or two of its most talented troopers they could probably still be fine, but when they lose eight, I think it really starts to impact things.

It's probably smart to have a small ensemble of crack troops to protect you (like Alexander's Companions), but let's emphasis a reasonable size.

A question for Australians: Does Julia Gillard's rise to be PM remind anybody else of Pertinax' ascension to the purple, assisted / forced by the Praetorian Guard (read: Labor Right / union heavies)? Obviously with the caveat that the assassination wasn't a literal assassination. I wonder if it will end any better if she doesn't bow to the whims of the AWU?

@ Mike L
Nice analogy but not quite accurate. 'Assasination' of PM Rudd came about because he had lost popularity with the plebs and had no internal power base within the ALP factions to counterbalance his fall in the polls. The history of ALP power politics shows that when the factions lose sight of how minute they are in relation to the general electorate they lose elections so they have tended to be more behind the scenes, jockeying for cabinet positions & preselection of candidates etc. rather than influencing actual policy positions (hence the general disdain for them within the electorate). Main thing to remember about Australian politics is that voting is compulsory so unions & other power bases are not needed to get people to turn up to the ballot box (which is why they are always held on a Saturday in good weather).

If you think this was ugly we have seen much worse. A PM serves as the leader of his/her party - when the party's MPs can't make up their minds or when there is a fight over the leadership it can paralyse/distract government for months. This happened with the last conservative government and the previous labour government.

Hi Mike
This is not really a direct comment on the episode, although it does meet with your usual high standard, but more a suggetion on the future of the Podcast as a whole.
Some time ago you addressed the issue of turning the Podcast into a book, but you were concerned that it was written to be spoken, and may not work in written form without major work. I beg to differ, and would strongly advise that you look at this again very closely.
Do you want to produce a work that can fit neatly onto an already overstocked shelf of retellings of Roman history? Does the world really need another standard format book on Rome, with the standard photo's and artwork?
You have produced a masterpiece.
You make 'Twelve Bizantine Rulers' by the great Lars Brownworth, in itself a wonderful publication, look like a pamphlet.
You should really think about a direct transcription, word for word. Right down to the detail on the 100th episode, and the contribution by Mrs History-Of-Rome. You should use your early hand-drawn diagrammes and maps. You should let it stand on it's own merit instead of trying to be something that it was never intended to be. It would certainly be a unique addition to the History shelf, and a talking point for the community on the whole.
Don't put down this wonderful thing you have created by trying to 'fit in'.
Well, there you go. My opinion, for what it's worth.

Hi All!
I was a school girl when Govenor General Kerr sacked the Whitlam government and installed a liberal caretaker. I thought the world would end in war! We hadn't had television for very long and it all played out on our black and white screen. I remember the grownups all talking about it for weeks. I had nightmares. I'm sure this is one of those events Nicole means when she says "....we have seen much worse...". The recent leadership spill in Australia, though dramatic, was much less messy. I can not imagine the HORROR of a leaders assasination, as our American friends have experienced in their history. This brings me to my point, the stress we live under today in everyday modern life can't possibly match that experienced by the people under the empire's yolk, the uncertainty, the fear of being captured and sold into slavery, the shortness of lifespans and high infant mortality. This is still occurring in some places around the world to some degree. We are the fortunate ones in many ways.

ps I agree with Steve O'Grady

This podcast has become a big thing for me. I'm kind of a Roman history nut, and this really turned it from "kind of interesting" to "life altering interest" for me. I've been listening since episode 23 or so and one of the highlights of my week is when a new episode comes out.

I'll be honest, I have every episode of this podcast along with Lars Brownworth's Byzantine podcast, and a couple of other snippets of other podcasts in a big play list(in chronological order from the beginning of
your podcast to the end of 12 Byzantine Rulers, which on days where there isn't new content I just pick a random old episode and listen til I get up to do something else.

I know that's more than just a little bit nerdy of me, but I'm currently unemployed and can't afford a car in a rural area with nothing to do. This podcast brings more than a little bit of happiness to my life because I see it as one big story to be told. All the world truly is a stage and Mike you make a wonderful narrator for this masterpiece. Roman history is something extremely meaningful to me.

I know you said it was highly unlikely, but I can't convey in verse how much it would mean to me if you kept going into the Byzantine era with your podcast. That would truly be, in my opinion, a brilliant piece of art in the historical field rivaling even Gibbon's Decline and Fall. If you do what Steve O'Grady suggested and leave everything in the format you have it now when you make that book it would be a work of art. It would be utterly unique in its field.

Just imagine, a history of the Roman Empire from beginning to end in both a book and a podcast. It's brilliant. I believe this would mean a lot to many more people than just me.

For the record, I just graduated high school and got my diploma yesterday. I'm 18 as of a few months ago. Don't ever underestimate the impact your work makes on people. THoR is part of life because history is now one of my biggest hobbies.

So Mike, thank you. Apologies to everyone else about possibly being overly sentimental about a podcast.

Hey Mike

Firstly thank you for the best podcast on I-Tunes.  I have enjoyed this for years now and it is the highlight of my commute into work.

Really enjoyed the Praetorian Guards version of The Price Is Right, but I have to ask, when Rome was in turmoil (and indeed in the reign of nutters like Caligula and Commodus) was there really no other world power that didn't use the opportunity to grab some of the Empire for itself?

Wow, Pertinax sounds like he was the reincarnation of Galba.  Stepped in after the bloody end of a dynasty.  Strict authoritarian who didn't feel the need to pay into the imperial protection racket.  Correspondingly short reign.

Hi Mike, As an Australian who has just watched our team try to defend against the Germans, I have an even greater appreciation of the challenges faced by the Romans on the German border. They just keep coming and coming over and over. Inflicting a heavy defeat against an undermanned opposition. OK I am just looking to make a link to the current world cup in South Africa,  (Maybe we will see Italy vs Germany and see how that goes?)

Thanks for a great Podcast, I am going to need a distraction from the current sporting events given the Australian team's form and there is nothing I enjoy more than traveling back in time to see how the empire is progressing. While on the topic maybe a show on sporting events in Roman times. We hear about the Games with gladiators and the related chariot events but what other sports were popular given the lack of football to entertain the crowds.

Kieran- clearly where the Australian team went wrong (and the Romans before them): you can't beat the Germans without the help of the Americans and Russians. And as far as Dutch coaches go, Pim is certainly no Guus... how can you leave Timmy Cahill up front alone?

Mike, I'd just like to add my thanks to the chorus. I've been listening for about six months now, and loving every minute of it. Prior to this podcast, I knew so little about Roman history, particularly republican history. The whole journey has been a real eye opener.

ThJrd- to me, Pertinax seems at least slightly more principled, less thuggish than Galba. But yeah, history seems to be repeating in a decidedly eerie manner.

Great episode, Mike. I'm impressed that you made the debasement of the princeps into such excellent entertainment; I felt like I was there as the Praetorians auctioned off the Emperorship.

But why were the Praetorians so stupid? Surely their greed alone couldn't have convinced them that auctioning off the most important office of the most important state of the ancient world wouldn't have any bad consequences for them.

You have been a blessing during the dark hours of driving across the country. Your podcast dovetails perfectly into Lars Brownworth's Lost to the West, History of the Byzantine Empire. Thank you so much for your time and great storytelling.

These Praetorians are a fickle bunch.

Didn't anyone try to mitigate their power in some way? Such as rotating members of the urban cohort through frontier legions, or creating several competing legions of Praetorians so that power couldn't coalesce?

After a quick warm-up Rommel paired us up and walked through the program of 6 exercises/stations on the whiteboard.  A quick blow of the whistle and everyone hustled through the 40 second interval at their first station which varied from chest presses to jump squats to bear crawls and even pushing/pulling the weighted 'sled' the length of the warehouse building. When the whistle blew again we had a few seconds to ready ourselves and get weights for the next station. We kept rotating stations every 40 seconds so the movements were pretty varied and quick-paced.  We used all sorts of equipment including kettleballs, the physioball and the BOSU for different parts of our workout. The last 5-10 minutes were spent on floor exercises that we all did together such as sit ups and plank-positionasdfed challenges. I've heard that when weather permits, this class is brought outside and incorporates short runs and obstacle courses which sounds really fun too!

The Part about Commodus as a Gladiator was a little scary but Mike did a great job on this episode. It was intresting escpacially the assaniaton. How did he get that close right after a botched assassination. It is also intresting that Commodus went so crazy and managed to make it 12 years as emperor. Why was he not stopped early? How did they botch 2 attempts? Commodus just went crazy after 190 AD. I guess that is what happens when you give a 19 year old become emperor. What style of gladitorial did Commodus practice? Why did he not serve in  the legions if he loved combat so much? He was crazy enough to begin a gladiator.
Thank You Mike for another Great Episode
Can not wait for the next one

Hi All!
I was surprised that such a terrible emperor lasted as long as he did. On reflection though, there would be modern despots that lasted longer, so that says something about modern society...we're no more clever or braver than the average Roman, if anything, we may be less so. For Chris and others...
While not just about the "fall" of the empire, Robin Lane Fox's "The Classical World" did put the ups and downs into perspective for me. His chapter near the end of the book, "Presenting The Past", is an interesting take on all the other history writers who covered the topic. As for Mike's podcast, it is up there with the best, and he is just getting to the start of the decline phase, so keep listening. This work will be referenced in other major works in the future.

For those interested in historical fiction, you may want to try "Caesar Dies!" by Talbot Mundy (worth reading for the title alone) about the assassination of Commodus. It manages to mix Bulwer-Lytton style writing with pulp-fiction themes, but manages to be fairly accurate in its historical points.

Mike, you mentioned that Commodus drove the empire into debt, meaning that all reserves in gold were spent and borrowing ensued.  My question is who was lending the money after all the gold was gone? Did Commodus give them IOU's???  ;-)  If Rome controlled all the sources of wealth, it would perhaps be wealthy individuals from the Empire/Senate, who probably lost their claims after Cleander took their estates thru prescriptions.  Thus wiping out the debt figuratively and literally.  Is that the case?

I think the reason people like Commodus, Domitian(if you see him as a cruel tyrant) and Nero lasted so long was because their rule was never in doubt or illegitimate. Commodus was part of an imperial succession dynasty going back 90 years. It would be hard for people to accept a usurper, as his muderers would be over him. The same goes for Domitian and Nero. Caligula I think was the craziesst of them all. He and Commodus just seem to have been insane. Nero at least was not all bad, and like Domitian, concerned himself with governance.

The same air of legitimacy continues today in North Korea with Kim Jong Il, and it was the same in Iraq. Inertia is the great friend of tyrants as people never want to change the status quo.

Dear All,

I've enjoyed the videos on YouTube from the lectures on "Roman Architecture" by Professor Diana Kleiner. The coverage is fantastic and exhaustive architecturally, but the history at times seems a bit suspect. She has been on various PBS and History Channel presentations before, so she might be familiar to some of you.

For example, in Lecture 17: Bigger is Better, Professor Kleiner discusses the death of Commodus.

Here is the link, and the relevant statements start at minute 47:40 (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhon2e3vfTo).">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhon2e3vfTo).</a>

Specifically, Professor Kleiner states that it was the "famous gladiator" Narcissus killed the Emperor in gladiatorial combat in the arena itself.

Of course, there are various and often contradictory stories of the Emperors from the ancient sources, but it is strange to see such a tremendously skilled Professor make such a definitive statement that contradicts with the podcast. Therefore, I was wondering if Mike could direct us (or, anyone else reading) to the sources that back the story in the podcast (i.e. that the Emperor was strangled in his private bath by his wrestling partner Narcissus). Also, Mike's description makes more sense in that a private assassination fits nicely with the fact that Pertinax's conspiracy to take over required speed, secrecy, and presentation to the army and Senate as a "fait accompli". A public slaughter in the arena does NOT further these ends.

I just wanted to mention it for comment - as it threw me for a bit of an historical loop.

Mike, you are brilliant!

- James

I wonder if the name "Commodus" does have any connection with the word "commode", quite apart from his behaviour, it might have been a very noble name in his time. I will have to go over his new episode a few times, there is, as already mentioned, so much in this one. Great work!

Somehow I stumbled on your podcast >1 year ago and am a devoted (if sporadic) 'reader' now being up to 66.  This beautiful afternoon I learned not only some Roman history but belatedly of Grandpa's passing and your (then) upcoming marriage.  Sympathies on the former, congratulations on the latter.  I  hope your wife shares the passion.  I cannot believe you got me hooked on this.  You are terrific in content and delivery.  A delight!  Thank you.

BTW, did you know that if you re-name past episodes to be three digits with leading zeroes, all your sorting problems would retreat into the Gallic wood?

As you have no doubt realized, alpha numeric sort of episodes places episode "3" next to episode "30". Just add the zeroes and stay consistent on the length and it all works out ;-)

Mike,

Not being up to the latest episode, one is always late to the party with comments, but here it goes. Your recommendation of Zinn was quite surreal. My conservative brethren have outed him sufficiently so I will not drag out the dead and now swollen horse for more critique. Let me just say that you have spent over a hundred episodes building your reputation on solid research and a heart-felt search for the truth. Why blow it with Zinn, who is not up to your standards? His works are agenda-driven and see American history through a leftist victim-hood prism. Lefft is right.

Mike,

Thanks for helping me impress my attending physician today on rounds.  I'm on an infectious disease rotation at my med school and today the boss asked us about a fungus called Candida lusitaniae, specifically why its species name was lusitaniae.  He was amazed when I was able to recite that Lusitania is basically modern day Portugal so the fungus was probably discovered there - he said I was the first student he'd ever taught to answer that question correctly.  I only knew it because I'd listened to the "Provincial Matters" episode last weekend, so seriously thanks man.

I thought you might enjoy the anecdote!

I discovered this podcast about 8 episodes back. Listen to it on my way back home from work. It makes the commute so much more tolerable. Thank you!

It would be a good idea to have a small Android or Iphone program with all the eps to choose from..maybe so people can listen to them in order or catch up?  I listen to it on Stitcher on my android phone.

Hi Mike,

I also want to say first of all, thanks for many hours of happy listening.  I have dozens of podcasts on my iPod and yours is the first one I listen to every week.

The thing I like best about the podcast is the way understanding Roman history sheds light on so much contemporary life from wedding ceremonies to conflict in the Middle East to country names, the Bible and salt and pepper.

I had a question I wanted to submit to the 100th episode, but was too late:

I've seen it written (in "Health of Soil" by Albert Howard) that the fall of the Roman Empire was due to a decline in soil fertility because of unsustainable farming practices. It seemed unlikely until I thought of "Collapse" by Jared Diamond in which he talks about how the people of Easter Island, the Norse colony in Greenland and several others disappeared because of unsustainable farming.  Is this something to be takes seriously in relation to Rome's decline?

Hi Mike,

I'm a huge fan. I love listening to one episode after another, so it's really difficult for me to wait a whole week for a new episode. I found the podcast when you were on #65 or so, and I listened to about 4-5 podcasts a day while I worked out. Man - I've never looked so forward to my workouts. Alas, now I've caught up and only work out about 20 minutes a week  :)

I just wanted to throw my support behind your recommendation of The People's History. Zinn's masterpiece opened up an entirely new perspective that we now take for granted as an alternative viewpoint into our history and culture. The fact that the book and Zinn have been picked apart for decades by those who feel uncomfortable with it's and his conclusions is a testament to the importance of the work and man.

With that said, it is ironic to look upon today's historians and the histories they write in relation to the roman historians. First off, as has always been the case, most of the written history seems to be about the elite and military campaigns vs. the common person (which is one of the main reasons Zinn's book stands out as being so important).  Even in today's free-thinking western cultures, there is societal pressure not to rock the boat. It is so interesting to think of the roman historians in the time of emperor x writing about the life and times of emperor x-1, and how much the popular and elite perceptions of the past would have played into what actually ended up being written.  I know you've talked about this during episodes and I appreciate the insight.  Finally, even with  all the bias that ran rampant in Roman histories, it's hard to imagine a Roman historian practicing critical introspection about the grandeur and righteousness of the Roman state.

Great episode! It's interesting to think just what Marcus might have accomplished had fate not been against him at every turn.

Thanks for the pictures of the column, in the rain miracle, I'm guessing the being in the sky with all they wavy things (rain?) is a roman god? Its a very interesting depiction, and im wondering, just how many surviving images of the gods as the Romans saw them do we have? And which god is this specific one?

Kinda a rhetorical question, but whoever wants to feel free to answer XD

Hi Mike, I've been barreling through your series since March this year.  As I'm seeing everyone else has been, the 'there will be no episode next week' was once just an expression which had no effect for me to skip months at a time but now it seems I'll be patiently waiting with the rest of them.

Coincidentally I started listening while I had a week to kill working in Austin, going for runs up and down the river walk.  This weekend I'm flying to Portland, and will probably be listening to the most recent by the time I get there.  It's a counter History of Rome tour.

A fine fine job, your obsession has become ours.

What I can not understand with these column narratives is why the city patrons ordered the sculptors to deliver so much detail when it made the story amongst the upper halves all but unreadable to any ancient audience save the crows. The pointlessness seems, well, to me at least, quite unpragmatic and so most un-Roman. The Bayeux Tapestry is infinitely more readable, literally with it's Latin script, and has the added utility of being able to be folded up for easy storage, or at least to be read by any discerning scholar at any elevation. Further to this, I wonder: perhaps Bayeaux is a blueprint, a draft script for a column that William I was musing on ordering to eternalise his conquest of England? Before he decided to spend the budgeted monies on more castle building, of course.

Thanks for a great series on Marcus Aurelius. He is now my favorite Roman emperor. He strikes me as perhaps the least uncynical potentate until you get to George Washington. Someone who despite his best intentions found himself as the crux upon which history would turn and decided he better make the most of it. Would you agree?

I know that this is totally off subject. However this is a burning issue that I have been agonising over for some time....

If the Romans and the Parthians were to meet directly in battle. Both empires had no distractions, they could afford to take all the garrisons away from the frontiers. Who would win?

Again this is completely off the point and I apologise.

Also, we know that the Romans had a powerful bureaucracy. Did that bureaucracy have the power of, to take an example. Yes minister (British TV, Show<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_minister.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_minister.</a> Where the civil servants are the ones that really run the government. Or was the Civil service there to serve the emperor or themselves.

The emperor must have delegated tasks to various people. If the civil service did something nasty, like declare war on something. Could the emperor discipline them (execute them).

You have told us that during the reign of Claudius the civil service had huge power (Narcissus), had their power declined in the reigns of the five good emperors. Or did it explode, like in yes minster, where the Ministers worked for the civil service not the other way round?

Does anyone else, like myself, think it a minor miracle that these columns have survived all these centuries? It always amazes me how they manage to escape the wrath of later invaders, who must have looked upon these monuments with utter hatred - them being symbols of their own defeat and all.
Think of what that column has seen and lived through in its lifetime.
To survive with only a change of statue (a great shame) is remarkable, and although the bottom (reachable) parts are well worn, it's in great shape.
Whoever took this picture should be knighted at once and given command of the tenth.

Too bad they replaced Marcus at the top with St. Paul but oh well, I'm glad we still have the pillar though. How did people at the time "read" it though, wouldn't it have been a bit high to be able to see the top half or top third of figures?

Unfortunately I have caught up with the podcast... now I can't listen to the Rome podcast every single day!
Thanks for the fantastic work :)

Walked past this everyday on the way to school when I was studying abroad in Rome. Some friends came to visit me at the end of the semester in Rome, and thanks to your podcast, I talked their ears off with things I have learned from your podcast. I was so excited to find it because, despite the fact that I was studying abroad in Rome, there wasn't a Roman history class available. Your podcast became that Roman history class I didn't get to take and I would listen to it on the 40 bus driving past the Capitoline Hill everyday. Quite the experience, and further enhanced by your great podcast.

In your episode, I believe it was the 100th episode, you said that you rated Marcus as on of the top five best emperors. After listening to the podcasts about his reign, I am still not entirely sure why that is true. He does seem to be a fairly capable and intelligent emperor especially for the mess that he was haphazardly thrown into, but so were many others, and it doesn't seem that he was all that distinct from what you said about him. So I was wondering if you had any more information on why he would be in the top five best emperors of Roam.

I'm using google listen to download the podcast, and they're all out of order with ep.73-84 totally missing.  Might be an RSS thing.

I found your podcast incidentally about a week ago, and its pushed both radio and other casts off my schedule. Good news is that I've had my classical education refreshed, bad news is that I have no idea what's going on in the world today ;)

Luckily I should be caught up by the weekend, and things can return to normal again.

I am in awe of your storytelling-skills, and have been recommending your excellent podcast to anyone who will listen.

I've often had to restraint myself from running up to randoms in the street and shaking them demanding to know if they have heard about just how awesome Trajan was or something similar. I've also gotten odd looks on the train for bursting out in laughter or smiling like a nut when some of the Mike-esque wit comes up.

Hello,

I thought your offhand comment about "Plug away on some discordant b flat" was interesting.  A while ago I head a story by Robert Krulwich (Radiolab) about B flat, and the frequency of the universe.

The story is very accessible and I encourage you to check it out:

Trajan and Hadrian separated the Emperor from Rome, but what were the macroeconomic factors that led to empire being split, the build up of the eastern empire, and the hollowing out of the western empire?  The fall of Rome seems more like the dissipation of the west, with momentum carrying it for another couple of centuries.

Are there any books you can recommend that cover the east/west divide particularly well.  The 5th century gets a lot of attention due to the sack of Rome and the many Roman military defeats, but the 3rd and 4th centuries seem more important (causal).  Also, why were the Germans, among others, so effective militarily?  Sheer numbers?  If so, what allowed their population to be so large?

Mike...I have no way of getting a hold of you, and the customer service e-mail address for Audibles that they sent me was bogus.  I never got the "free" download, and I have so far been charged about 30 bones over the past 2 months for a service I have not used, and attempted to cancel.  Repeatedly.  I cannot get a hold of anyone there to rectify the matter, and the only reason I embraced it to begin with is because I LOVE your podcast.  In retrospect, I should have just sent the cash as a donation to your new lair in Austin!  It would have been less frustrating and more worth it to me!  I wouldn't have reached out to you, but I can't get a hold of ANYONE at AUDIBLE.

Thank you for this most superb podcast!  I discovered it about a month ago and listened straight through. You break it down into nice, compact narratives and the only complaint is that I often want more.  I enjoy your detours from the Emperors to explore life at the time, and you will get no complaint here if you did it more often. For example, in the past few episodes I was wondering how the plague impacted life outside of the Legions. Were all the provinces hit? Was it viewed as divine retribution? Did Rome try to appease the Gods somehow? Did they lock up Rome to keep the sick out? etc.

I'd love to know more of these sorts of facts, but I see how much time you already put into these episodes so am quite happy with whatever you are able to put together.  Thank you!

Hi Mike, Love the podcast and yeah, I know I'm like a week or so late and others have already commented on this matter........ but Howard Zinn?????   Really????  That's a bit disappointing from a "High Rebublican era" kind of guy.  I think Mr. Zinn's work should be read but there should probably be a precursor to that recommendation like "yeah, if you've ever wondered how someone with wild socialist views recounts american history.... you might want to listen to...."  Not sure if it's available on audible but may I recommend A Patriot's History of the United States.  Either way the podcast still rocks, keep up the good work!  Can't wait for that Joaquin guy to come of age (if he ever actually did) and start naming everything after himself.

I just wanted to say that I started listening after your third podcast and though this is my first comment I have been wanting to tell you how much I look forward to "The History of Rome" every week. Though I admit to some disappointment about your plan to not follow the history of the east after Romulus is deposed I can understand and simply want to add my voice to those who beg you to give it a second thought when the time comes. My focus has been Mediterranean History from a time before I was in college and love your boiled down pieces of great story telling and dry wit and the way they hold my attention and engage my imagination in a way that even Livy sometimes fails to do. Go luck and bonus fortuna quod se gero. Cheers!

I ran across this article on Constantine and thought you might be interested in it when you come to that topic.  It's a bit vitriolic here and there but still very interesting reading.

Have any of you all read Meditations? I just read a Gregory Hays translation, which i liked, but some of the online versions didn't seems as accessible.

Hi Mike!
Look after that voice of yours! Another fascinating episode, thankyou! I have purchased Lars Brownworth's book as you suggested and am yet to start it as I am at present reading Norman Davies' "Europe, A History". Its a rather thick tome so it will take me a while and I'm enjoying the well ordered way it is set out. I find the majority of my purchases as second hand/pre-loved books from a site on the internet. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the site on this page but they have never disappointed me. If anyone wants to know, I'm happy to say as long as the administrator doesn't mind. With winter fast approaching in Tasmania, I need a stash of books to get me through!

I really lost a lot of affinity toward the podcast after that.  I hope that as a student of history you shake the influence of that sort of propaganda as time goes by.

The demerits include highly selective use of citations and statistics,  clearly biased argument construction and an occasionally laughable amount of "good" labor vs "evil" imperial capitalists commentary.

The merits include the fact that everyone ought to read the book at least once.

I don't see why any student of history should waste his time with something that displays no fidelity to, you know, actual history. Further, Zinn's claptrap is not a shot against the establishment.  It's 2010, the late Zinn and his ilk are the establishment.  their point of view owns the academy and the elite media.  If you want to whistle your professors' / NPR's tune, read Zinn, but don't act like you are being edgy somehow.  You want to be "edgy" and show independent thought: read something conservative in a faculty lounge sometime.

Dear Mike,

First, I rarely come to your website; the only post I made in the past was to thank you for your wonderful podcast, soon after I discovered it.

But I just had to come on your 'site to thank you for the Zinn love.

Thank you.

And sorry you have to put up with the conservative whiners, who whine about Zinn because, well, he's a leftist, and they really hate it when people aren't following their script.  And, I suppose, because they are just plain whiners.

As to the merits of their conservative whinings, as someone once said, they are "so blatantly a merest piece of propaganda".

Keep up the good work.

Hey Mike,

Long time listener - I have been passing your podcast around to colleagues and friends for a while now - first time commenting. I have taken my interest in Roman history to new levels from listening to your podcast.

For instance - I am planning on making Roman Legionary Standards this summer.

Also, I am writing my dissertation on Roman Architecture as an extension of Roman Rhetoric (visual rhetoric) to communicate their values and ideas. My PhD is going to be in Rhetoric, but my BA was in History and I have a strong love of art. I have been to Rome and Pompey, awesome places, definitely plan to go back. If you don't mind passing around my dissertation concept, I am looking for ideas and directions to look for sources.

Thanks,

Long time listener first time Poster.

Zinn is fine, its an alternative to a traditional history of the United States. The one thing I find amusing is while people give it scathing remarks, they never talk about any specific issues..only that it is trash or worse..never a specific passage they have an issue with. It's not my bible but it is in my library.

Zinn's work is trash because it's profoundly dishonest.  Anyone can cobble together a 'history' of a nation or race that makes it look relentlessly villainous merely by sticking to the 'right' facts.  And if you have 300 years to work with you can drone on for thousands of pages in the same vein.  If you do something like this about the Jews, you will rightly be called a vicious anti-Semite, but if you do it about the USA, you are telling a strangely compelling 'alternative history'.  Blech.

Great podcast, otherwise.

You're still doing an excellent job Mike. As a side note I think Mike proves the point that intelligent people don't need to have a PHD. I don't know if he has any letters after his name but I get only find them annoying myself.

I haven't read The people's History but it's my to do list. I'm slightly put off by those who say it's dishonest etc but my opinion of the US, being form the UK, is that it's the world's greatest social experiment that ultimately has an unhappy ending. Ok I'm keeping it very simple. But there is everything to love and hate about humanity right there in the pages of everyone's history. Including Rome's.

Dude, Matthew, Peoples History is in my library too, but so is the Poky Little Puppy.  Sure everyone can't help but put their slant on things, but its not an accurate dichotomy of American history.  It's commentary, which is fine, as long as it's portrayed as such.  Still, I would not say the man is innacurate in his portrayal of basic inhumanity which is a facet of human existence, not the hallmark of one society.  The Great Experiment here is falling apart thanks to the hatred of Law and the love of Goverment, so who knows maybe we just took the Roman model and turned the dial to 11.

For Matthew Cohen!
The "Roman genius" is mentioned on page 150 of Norman Davies' Europe - A History, he says.."The Roman genius was projected into new spheres- especially into those of law, military organisation, administration and engineering...produced literary and artistic sensibilities of the highest order...many leading Roman soldiers and statesmen were writers of the highest calibre."
I hope this is helpful.

I'm OK with reading Zinn, I guess.  He's not a great scholar, but at the least I suppose maybe some of these voices have yet to be turned into an afternoon special.  A good counterpoint would be Paul Johnson's A History of the American People.  One benefit: Johnson is rigorous with his sources.  Zinn is typically sloppy on that front.

I'm still upset about the Third Punic War. It was such a big misunderstanding and completely unnecessary. I could say the same about the English Civil War or the American Revolution, the Mideast conflict since Oslo, all of which do not seem inevitable conflicts but accidents, the result of stubbornness and just plain not thinking about the other side. I'm sure I could think of more, like the revolt of Cassius against Marcus Arelius, the Jewish uprisings in 70, 110, and 131. Well, scratch that last one: if there are three case, then some of them must be inevitable. Stupid, but inevitable.

Really Howard Zinn?  The earlier poster was right.  If you want to be controversial read a Thomas Sowell or an issue of the National Review at your university faculty lounge.  That takes guts.  Reading Zinn or the Nation is gutless.  I would never say not to read something, because that is exactly what Howard Zinn and his totalitarian ilk would do.  I hope this was just to stir the pot, because otherwise I really have to question the entire narrative of this podcast.

Hey Mike,

Sorry for the late comment on this episode, i've been working my way from the beginning.  Close to catching up.

I thought you'd be interested in an additional angle on the "Rain" miracle.  Albus Butler in his "Lives of the Saints, Vol 1" makes mention of a saint by the name of St. Apollinaris the apologist, who apparently wrote several letters to Marcus Aurelius during his time as emperor apologising for the Christian religion (I suspect by apologise, he means, explain about).  One in particular mentioned the Rain miracle itself.

Apparently, according the Apollonius, the twelfth legion, called the Melitine, from a town of that name in Armenia, was chiefly composed of Christians.  These, as the legions were perishing of thirst, fell to their knees in prayer and prayed for their salvation, and that of their emperor despite his persecution of the Christians.

Apparently the sight of a legion falling on their knees surprised their enemies, "who had more reason to be astonished at the event; for all on a sudden the sky was darkened with clouds, and a thick rain showered down."

Obviously there were a million explanations for this event, from chance, to the gods, to "magic", but Albus (or Apollinaris, it isn't clear who makes the claim) notes that Marcus must have at least considered the possibility, as he immediately gave the legion the name of "the Thundering Legion".

Apparently the apology was written to the emperor in an attempt to ease the persecution of Christians (who, I assume, still suffered under Trajan's paradoxical accusation laws) by reminding the Emperor what he had gained from the Christians in his own time of need.

Makes an interesting side-story to the battle in any case, and no doubt would have been another prod in the growth of the cult during this period.

Dear Mike,

I just wanted to thank you so much for making this podcast! I found it when perusing podcasts on itunes to start listening to - and it has completely changed my interests. I always enjoyed military history - especially WWII - but i now have found that your storytelling capability (which is outstanding), combined with the rich history Ancient Rome has to offer has created a new favorite time period for me! I am actually writing a college essay on THoR.

My dad has also picked up your podcast and he loves it too. Hopefully i will catch up too - I spent the whole summer listening in my free time!

thanks for all your hard work,

Lawrence

Love the podcast! I listen to it every day on the way to work and back. Made it to episode 100 so far and I hope it will never end! ;-)

For this episode and a few others around this time frame, a maybe minor thing, but the Dacians of Decebalus didn't completely vanish, allowing the Germans to roam free.

Check the Costoboci and Carpi tribes, assumed by most historians as free Dacians:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costoboci#Conflict_with_Rome">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costoboci#Conflict_with_Rome</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Dacians">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Dacians</a>

Yes, I am Dacian fan ;-)

Best regards,

Here's another link to the very good BBC podcast, In Our Time. This episode discusses Roman satire.

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s0gwd">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s0gwd</a>

On another note, I was curious about the Roman communication system. In this episode, you mention that the Roman governor of Britain was summoned to fight the Parthians. How would this communication have taken place and how long did it take for word to get to Britain from Rome? Any information would be enlightening for folks like me who cannot think beyond telephones, the internet and VOIP for communications!!

Great show and I am truly happy to have found so much joy from listening to your podcasts.

This has nothing to do with this episode but if its ok and as I dont think there's going to be another question show for a while, I would like to know more about religion in the Roman Empire. I know you've mentioned bits like Jupitar, Mars, the sacred chickens and you did a show on christmas. And as the romans are very relgious, it would be nice to know more and if I can be really bold maybe a show or two on  the weard, wounderful and day to day things of roman religion.

Mike, just a quick note to say how much I have enjoyed your podcast so far. I only discovered it a couple of weeks ago and have just reached Marius and Sulla. My fascination with Rome stems from just last September when I visited the city on honeymoon. Since then I've read around the subject a great deal but very little of it approaches the accessibility of your offerings. Thanks for your continued efforts which are successfully feeding what is fast becoming an obsession.

One question, at this point we have met with the death of Lucius, and from his acts described he hardly seemed nearly 'worst emperor of all time' material. As portrayed, he appeared a shameless hedonist, but aside from taking an excessive amount of time to arrive in Syria, no horrible acts were described. Was Lucius up to any foul deeds which went unremarked upon? Also, if you don't mind the inquiry, what primary sources are being used for this period?

I think he understates how great your podcast is, but overall a good review.  Esp given how most other podcasts fair in Jim's opinion.

Thanks for all the great work you put into these.

Thank god for you Mike. I sit in an hour of LA traffic to work and an hour back and have gone through the entire series twice now. I feel like somewhat of a Roman Empire aficionado at cocktail parties and at my local pub. Some people want to sit next to me and some can not get away quick enough (usually girls, and no offense to any women that dig Roman antiquity). My wife rolls her eyes when I get started on the ol: "Well that reminds me of what Julius Caesar said when he returned from Gaul". Too bad there aren't any stories about kittens and cute shoes tied into the writings of Suetonius!

Great episode I love the explination of the Parthians I really needed that being only 14 and having only the medicore public middle school history classes, can you do an explination on the Moors. This podcast has taught me so much. I have really had to think about the topics as I ride home on the school bus trying to mute out the crazy kids around me and I really try to think about the topic. I would love to see an episode purely on the empires, kingdoms, and tribes that surrounded and influenced the Romans. My friends and peers (except for my history loving friends) just hate it when I go on and on about The History of Rome. I even have been laughed at for my love of history but I don't hide it I embrace it. THANK YOU and contuine on with your great work

I think you may be talking about Silphium, it was like fennel only bigger (genus Ferula). The Romans thought it was very precious and apparently used it to treat fever, warts, as a
contraceptive etc. Look it up on Wikipedia, there may be more info there.
It was good to get back to the leading characters in THoR. I did enjoy the trip around the empire though. Well done Mike!

Mike!
The Lancer's and Dylan's posts makes me think of a topic for digression in the future..healthcare!
With reforms in your own contry and in Australia on the political adgenda, it would be interesting to hear about how the Romans dealt with their healthcare needs, medicine, prosthetics (There would be quite a few amputees, what with all those wars!) and how much religion played a role in curatives. How did doctors become doctors, and a question close to my heart..were there nurses and midwives? Did doctors perform operations, like the one performed on Titus Pullo on "Rome" (HBO)? How was birth, death and burial rituals handled? As for sport, well that's a worth a few episodes alone!

Hi Mike, thanks for a great series, and I'd like to ask about something you mentioned in the last episode.. You were talking about how long the Empire was a major player in the Mediterranean. I think though you may have exaggerated a little (but I could be wrong). If I understand right, the last couple of hundred years of Byzantine empire it was quite weak. If at all possible, what is your estimation of what was the stretch of time when Empire was truly one of the top 2-3 major powers in the Mediterranean and the stretch when it was at least a contender for the top spot. thanks!

Mike,

I'm a writer/editor and have worked in publishing for about 15 years, independently for the past five. I've coauthored a book of pop history (World War II on the Air, 2003) along the way, and I'd love to help you transform your scripts into book form. I've been reading about ancient Rome for several years now (and listening to your podcast) just for fun, so I'd jump at the chance to dig into it professionally. Whether you're looking for help in organizing/editing, writing, putting together a book proposal, finding an agent, or just need some free advice, I'd be happy to help. Please contact me if you're interested in discussing it. (I wasn't sure how else to get in touch, so I hope this makes sense.)

Thanks,
Alex (alex.lubertozzi@sbcglobal.net)

I've been reading Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series, and having such fun connecting all the awesome things I know from this podcast to McCullough's general outline. Though her books are historical fiction, they're really good. Try them (and this is to the general public, not just Mike).

Mike,
You tallied up 329,186 words - I'm impressed! Hey I have a suggestion regarding publishing. Please be sure to make it available on eReaders (Kindle, iPad, etc). I'm not a publisher, but I know it will definitely expand your audience base. There are a few books that I've put off buying because they're not yet available on  Kindle. I'm sure Alex can help you set that up.
Thanks
P.S. You rock man!

great episode. It was definitely worth the wait. I love your answer of what three words would you describe the romans, they say it all: "veni, vidi, vinci".

I only missed that people didn't ask enough about your personal life, to a respectful point obviously, I would have like to know where your are from, where you grow up and what you do for a living, other then making  history podcasts to rival 12 Byzantine rulers and the Napoleon podcast in scope and quality.

Mrs. History of Rome, I loved your entrance. At last we get a glimpse of the woman that captives and inspires Mr. History of Rome to do great podcasts. Hope to hear your voice again in some future podcast if ever a chance should present itself.

Mike, I can't thank you enough for the endless hours of dedication and effort you put on each and every episode. You really made a difference in my life and of thousands out their that await eagerly for each morsel of roman history you cooked for us every week.

May your way be bless by the goddess Fortuna in all your endeavors.

Loved the episode.
Might I make comment defending the depiction of Lucius Vorenus in Rome the TV sees. Lucius is depicted as an idea Roman, not a modern hero. That will inevitably make much of what he does unpleasant & unlikable to us. Any other Roman historic drama would have made him the villain, having a hero who we can sympathise with but the writers chose to make him the central character, helping to bring roman values front & centre for the entire show.

I cannot find Rome versus Rome anywhere on the internet, can you give more information about it. Thanks

Francesco,

The 1964 epic that Mike referred to as one that should be required viewing for all students of history is actually titled "Rome against Rome".  Do a search on Netflix. You will find it there.

I thought it might be an accout of the power struggle between the Caeserians and the Republicans, but it appears to have more to do with how the Roman empire ultimately devoured itself.

Mike,  Thanks for the tremendous effort you put into the production of this podcast.

A brilliant episode and as always I have so many more questions (which is good), but thats for other days.
If you do this book, which I would be very intrested in. I hope it gets published over in the UK so us british fans don't have to pay import charges (I know cheap skate comes to mind) and that you have some of your maps etc. on there as well as maybe a little reference bit in it as well. Anyway until I get a time machine to go in the future and get it, I will wait and keep enjoying your podcast and woundering what to do until your next podcast comes out.

Mike,
Incredible job, just like you always do. Considering how much enjoyment I get out of your podcast each week, the least I can do is offer up some free help to you on the future book project. I have no contacts in publishing, but I work for a PR firm, adore history and am--I humbly state-- an excellent writer. I can think of nothing more enjoyable than spending a few hours each week plowing through your transcripts and tweaking them into a publishable format. If you need the man-hours, I would be honored to provide them. If you don't, no worries, and no offense will be taken.

The folks at Netflix must be scratching their heads to figure out why a 45 year old zombie flick set in ancient Rome is suddenly getting posted at the top of so many movie queues.

Well played sir, well played.

Another terrific podcast.  I hope you'll take questions again before the 200th episode -- it was great fun hearing what other fans are interested in and your always trenchant replies.  Thanks for the many hours (days?!) of listening enjoyment.

It is quite a commitment in time and I wonder how history students 500-1000 years from now will view the work.

Just want to echo many of the comments you get thanking you for your podcast. I listen to them over and over - while I am riding to work, if i wake up in the middle of the night and cant get back to sleep and while I am doing the housework.  It is always v exciting when there is a new episode to listen to.  and thanks to Mrs History of Rome for allowing you all the time you put into this podcast when you could be doing things around the house or keeping her company.

while i think a book would be good, I would like to see a great history channel series which goes for several years too starring you and Mrs HoR of course.

thanks again

Dear Mike,

thanks for the wonderful hundredth episode and for all the ones before. I enjoyed every single bit for I am a graduate in history myself.
One listener had a question about when Latin died out as a language and you were definitely on the right track when you dated it around the reign of Charlemagne.
But there was a certain event during the reign of Charlemagne that can be identified as a mark for the end of Latin.
By the time of the late eigth century the Latin language had long since developed into debased regional varieties in the lands that once were part of the Western Roman Empire. The situation had grown so bad that most people from the clergy still could read Latin but pronounced it so terribly that they were in danger of unconsciously spelling out heresies when they were performing the mass.

Ironically, the purest Latin in the eigth century was spoken by Irish and English monks and missionaries who had to learn it directly from the classic authors for it was not their native tongue.
A lot of these people, as you sure know, were influential advisers at the court of Charlemagne, Alcuin being the most prominent one.
So Charlemagne as heir to the Roman Emperors and thus being the lord of all Christendom decided that the Latin of the classic authors like Cicero or St.Augustine should be the only valid form in secular and in ecclesiastical matters.
Thus Latin was frozen into the classic form we identify today as proper Latin, mainly for reasons of liturgical accuracy.

I hope I could help. Keep on rockin´ Rome, Mike. I´m a big fan!

Kai

As for a book... well I think audio books work just fine, and you are producing one of those right now! No one said the printed version has to come first (or at all)!

I really appreciated your answer on America compared to Rome -- we have only been around for a blink of an eye, let the comparisons come if we are still around in a few hundred years.

I will say that in regards to comparisons and the fall of Rome, I think of St. Augustine and his work the "City of God" where he defends Christianity from those who blamed the sack of Rome on the peoples abandoning the old Roman gods for this new Christian faith.  I know this is my own religious beliefs here, so disagree with me.  But seems a certain amount of blame for America's decline is directed toward the Christian church butting into politics.

Augustine's point was that all Cities of Man (empires) will ultimately crumble and fall, even mighty Rome, but the City of God is eternal.

Hi Mike!
Don't stress, your loyal fans will wait...Rome wasn't built in a day! I'm listening to the series again from the beginning and encourage all to do the same as there is soooo much information and so many characters that I need a reminder as to who did what. This is an epic body of work and you deserve the Grass Crown as you have saved the legions from dying of boredom by watching TV! Quality is worth waiting for.

Speak for yourself Luise, I live in Prague (GMT +1) and the podcast is usually uploaded as I'm showering and getting ready for work and then I listen to it on the way to work, coming back from work and sometimes as I'm tying to fall asleep.  Mike, buddy, I'm not getting my THoR fix.

Mike:

   I'm knew to the podcast, but am now up to ep. 44. Very well done. I have a suggestion, and if it has been made before, I apologize, but like I said, I'm new to the podcast. You seem to have a problem knowing when to use the word "may" and when to use "might" instead.
 I can't cite an actual sentence from your podcast because I'm usually listening as I'm driving, so can't jot down an actual quote. But here is an example of what I mean:
 Let's say you're describing a battle in which luck favored the Roman general, who enjoyed a stunning victory and saved the empire. You very likely would say something like, "Were it not for this stroke of luck, General Whatsit may have lost the battle and Rome may have fallen."
What the sentence calls for is "might" not "may" in both instances.
 You do this a lot. I think I hear it at least once, and often more, in each episode. As a simple rule of thumb, just say "might" whenever your script says "may" and you'll be right more often than you're wrong.

Glenn M. may be a grammatical black pot, but I think he might be correct, at least as far as his example goes. However, I wouldn't recommend simply replacing every "may" with "might." That might not be such a good idea. Peter's right that might is the past tense of may, but it's also used in the present tense in cases where a statement is uncertain or contrary to fact (as in the subjunctive mood, which Glenn is using in his example). Ain't grammar fun?

I'm working on putting out a history podcast this summer and was wondering if you had any pearls of wisdom to pass along. I don't know if it'll ever happen as school/work/listening to your podcast get in the way of me doing the research and writing needed for a good work. But if you have any tips please pass them along.

Thanks

Hello Mike,

Congratulations on your 100th episode (even though i am still only up to 99). I am greatly enjoying the journey. Also i have really appreciated the recent eps on Roman life, education etc. Earlier on there was a lot of military history which was somewhat interesting but i was really hankering after more info about how these people just lived day to day - so thanks for that. It has added a real flavour to the experience for me. any chance of a bit more info about how the women lived? And whether they could wield genuine political power - at all? Guess I should have made that a question for teh 100th.

Telling all my friends about your podcast.

Salve!  Friends and fans of THOR!

The Century episode Q&A was uber awesome!

Mike mentioned doing a segment on Roman Law in the past...I know we are moving forward now, but any word on when this *might* happen?  I just finished reading Anthony Everitt's CICERO, AUGUSTUS and moving on to his bio of HADRIAN.  The way the law worked is pretty complicated, and I hope that our main man Mike will bring it to Earth for us...what say you?

Hi I'm a UK listener and love your podcast’s above any other that I follow each week. Great job once again loved it and will hear it many more time before the next podcast. However the Audible.com 14 day trial dose not seem to apply. To this once described by your podcast, "foggy back water island at the edge of the world". So just be aware that UK listeners have to make do with a £3.99 intro prices increasing to £7.99 after 3 months. Sigh lol

Hi Mike,

One question on this week's podcast - I thought I heard you say that the product of one province (don't remember which) was corn.  I'm pretty sure corn was only available in the New World after European contact.  Did I hear you wrong?

I haven't commented before, so let me say that I've really been enjoying your podcast so far - I look forward to it every week (or so).  Even my wife (not a history afficianado) enjoys the gentle humor that you are able to inject.  Thanks and keep up the good work.

Corn is a generic term for crops like wheat, barley etc. not the 'corn on the cobb' variety. This confused me too when studying the English Corn Laws of the eighteenth century. I now think of 'corn' in this context as anything that can be made into bread.

I cant download these episode episode. I've heard it on the web but i cant get itunes to download it.
Also, chapter 28 is still missing from the itunes library.

These was a great episode, a very good and needed review of the extend and resources of the empire. Thanks a lot.

Also, you always talk about Egypt been the bread basket of the empire, also i have heard of the revolts that took great strength from the resources of Egypt during the 3th century. So how did these work?? because there is no way that Egypt could be considered anyone's bread basket now a days. What happened there??

Along the lines of learning about daily life in ancient Rome, I recently picked up a book called "A Taste of Ancient Rome" by Ilaria Gozzini Giacosa (trans. Anna Herklotz). It's an actual cookbook based on recipes mostly from Apicius's 1st century AD cookbook, Cato the Elder, and others. It's fascinating. The Romans managed to be quite the gourmands, even without tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chocolate, or coffee. (It helped if you liked garum, a fermented, salty fish paste found in almost everything.) Don't know if it's still in print, but used copies are easy to find.

Also, great recommendation on Tuchmann's "A Distant Mirror" on the 14th century in Europe. I read it years ago and loved it. I recently read Morris Bishop's "The Middle Ages," which is a similar survey of the entire era. Very engaging and well-written.

Hi Mike,

I haven't gotten up to 88 yet (I'm around 50 where Augustus is still alive), but I wanted to let you know how great this podcast is and how much I love it. Thanks for putting so much time and effort into the series. It's clear that you love the subject.

Hello Mike, awesome podcast. I've been enjoying it immensely. I'm on episode 82. Sent a small donation for the cause, and in the hopes of getting more. If you ever want to go to 6th, ping me, hehe.

Completely off topic of course, but I've been reading the book Napoleon's Wars which deals with the political and diplomatic relations of Napoleons, and how those caused by his downfall, mostly by his ego. Very good read into that era.

Hey Mike,

Just wanted to drop the obligatory thanks-for-the-podcast message that your new listeners seem to do.  I've been playing catch-up for the past couple months, and am finally up-to-speed right before a trip to Rome during Holy Week.  From a Renaissance-English-lit-scholar-to-be who will likely be too busy with the 16th century to fill in my holes in ancient history in the next five years, thanks for podcast!

Hi Mike - fantastic podcast. Been listening to it from the beginning. I'm  in the UK - have you visited yet? Plenty of Roman sites to explore in the rain. And thanks for inspiring my daughter to learn Latin -in homage to you,  we've now visited Palmyra, Jerash and Bosra to check out the Roman ruins there. Worth a trip, especially Bosra. You are a genius - keep up the great broadcasting.

The History of Rome is The Best Podcast in the history of podcasts!  I've tried all the others.  It's so good, I don't need tv.  You are the Caesar Augustus of history podcasts, the others aren't even Nero in comparison.  You're also the Romulus, Scipio Africanus and Julius Caesar of ALL podcasts.  Five month hiatus?  You've earned it!  Nothing this good writes itself. (i.e. 'The price of democracy is eternal vigilance . . . on the width if hallways.'  Brilliant!) I'm counting the days to Macrus Aurelius.

Thank You.

Hi Mike,

Loved the episode, but I have one minor critique.
You talked about wine in the Roman world.  To my knowledge, there's no evidence that the wine that the Romans mixed with water was concentrated.  I don't think any distillation or concentrating processes were available until much much later.  The Romans would probably have been mixing regular old wine with water.
Which would be difficult to get drunk off of.  Getting wasted was looked down upon in Rome, from what I can tell.

But the stuff I read mostly has to do with the late Republic; customs could certainly change over the centuries.

Anyone know anything about whether mixing wine with water would kill off dangerous microbes?  Besides flavor and a slight relaxing effect, not getting water borne diseases would be a great reason to have wine with your water.

@ Valerie and Roman wine:  I too had read many years ago that Romans mixed water into their wine when they drank it, and I assumed it was just plain wine, nothing concentrated.  And when I heard Mike mention concentrated wine, I also wondered how that could have been done without distillation.

But a bit of poking around on the web indicates that concentrated wine was indeed produced in ancient times.  I haven't found an entire piece on the topic, but enough bits of info to declare that my assumptions were wrong, and Mike is most likely right.

This was a really cool and informative episode.  Though I know that much of what happens during a certain periods in Roman history is shaped and directed by the emperor, learning about the actual life of the citizens is very interesting.  Especially interesting to learn about how modern day customs are either similar to Roman ones due to pure practicality (like night-time deliveries) or derived by tradition (like a lot of the education and marriage stuff, for example).

So please, if you are taking suggestions for future episodes, more of this daily stuff would be really awesome.  (Of course, I could just read the relevant books, but you know.)

The advantage of your podcast, of course, is that you take a lot of dry autobiographical and archeological material and turn it into an entertaining show.  I think I speak for all of us when I say we greatly appreciate it.

I'm a huge fan of this podcast. I have one critique of this episode, however. You mentioned that pumpkins were consumed by Romans. This is not possible since they are a new world crop and did not exist in the old world before the columbian exchange in the 15th century.

Yeah, me too.  Calling it a "cult", for example, is a little sketchy.  From a purely objective standpoint I could see that, but there's miles of difference between a religion of peace, universal brotherhood and equality, and one that requires someone to walk backwards on Thursdays.  My guess is that Mike is trying to be 100% objective and unbiased.  I hope.

Mike does a great job, and he's entitled to his opinion\analysis.

If anyone is interested, a web site that is not so much about podcasts, but free audio books.

<a href="http://librivox.org/">http://librivox.org/</a>

My first suggestion is:
"A short history of the US" by Edward Channing.

Jonathan:
A 'cult' is defined by Webster's as "1: formal religious veneration, 2: a system of religious beliefs and ritual, also its body of adherents, 3: a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious." Mainstream Roman society regarded it as unorthodox and spurious at this time, so all three definitions fit.  It should be kept in mind that it was one of several eastern religions that had percolated into Roman society at this time. Moreover, the word 'cult' gets used a lot in English-language works on classical history - in my experience it seems to denote the adherents of a specific object of veneration or a specific system of rites rather than a broad generality like 'the Greco-Roman religious tradition.'

Thanks.  That does make more sense in light of his use of the term.  I still don't agree with the exact way he goes about his discussion of Christianity, but that's my opinion and I hope Mike doesn't derive any offense from it-- none is certainly meant.  This is an outstanding podcast.

Mike:  If you feel like answering a question from a badger, can you tell me to what extent Rome has contact with Asia at this point in their history?  Have the spice trade lanes, for example, been established, or are we still a few decades/hundreds-o-years off from that?

Fantastic! This episode stands out as a superb example of thought provoking podcasting at it's very best. Mike, you've exceeded yourself. Wax slate and stylus, the rise of eastern mysticism and perpatetic philosopher grunge - Stoic, Epicurean, Christian or Capitalist you cannot but admire the parallels between a typical 2nd century Roman synapse and those that go into deciding wether the iPad is really worth a week or two's entire salary.

On the issue of Christianization, I think Mike pays the early church a huge compliment noting that it was only the innate egalitarianism of early Christian teaching that offered the impoverished mass any notion of personal worth. That all people were of equal spiritual value and that all labour had it's price, cost and value. No matter what your religious views, I think it's partly thanks to Jesus Christ I can afford to buy myself a home. And as a confirmed Humanist I mean that in the strictest economic sense.

Great work Mr Duncan!

I was wondering if you could go into more detail on the day to day logistics of the Roman economy.  How did grain move from Egypt to Rome, in a guarded convoy, or in single ships?  Did specific businesses or market concerns (for example, millers) purchase raw materials from faraway parts of the Empire and have them brought to Rome, or did wholesalers purchase products and sell them to local businesses?  How much food did it take a single day to feed Rome, and how was food brought into the city and distributed properly?  Did Rome export a lot of goods to other parts of the Empire, or did the provinces trade amongst themselves?  Was there a difference in how bulk goods and precious goods were transported?  How about perishable/nonperishable goods?  And how long did it take for products/materials to be transported from one end of the Empire to the other? Did most goods move across the Empire by land, by river, or by sea?

My thoughts on Mike's "alleged" bias.

Kardinal's question and the responses were certainly asked and responded to in a respectful way and I'm sure there was no offense intended towards Mike but...

In calling Christianity a "cult", it seemed to me that Mike is merely using an editorial device and taking us into the mindset of the polytheistic Roman culture.  Something Mike does quite a bit to varying degrees.  Surely, a majority of the Romans must have thought of Christians as just that.  A cult.  Using devices such as this is what makes this podcast both interesting and unique.

Yes please continue this podcast through to the fall of the byzantine empire. There's another podcast called "12 Byzantine Emperors" that is just absolutely terrible because its whole viewpoint is that Byzantium was a shining beacon that stopped the "evil brown musselmen" from getting into europe.

Would way rather listen to Mike's take on it.

I would love to follow the narrative into the late Roman, or, Byzantine period.  I find that Alex is wrong; Lars never refers to the Byzantines as combating either "evil" or "brown" "musselmen".  Brownworth's research is actually quite admirable.  Have you seen theodorechristou.ca?  Teachers in New Brunswick (Canada) are similarly inspired...
Mike, your podcast is impeccable.  Admirable.  Best wishes.

On the issue of Christianity as a cult, keep in mind that early Romans, because of the liturgy surrounding the Eucharist, actually thought Christians ate babies.  In Gaul there were some Christian communities who were persecuted essentially because they were thought to be committing acts of murder and cannibalism of children.

From the Roman perspective, that sure qualifies as a cult, even if we, with the benefit of being steeped in 2000 years of Christan culture, know better.

Coming to this very late, but consider what "Cult" meant then, and means now.

Pre-Christian Roman religion essentially consisted of veneration of numerous, possibly innumerable, supernatural entities. While we user the term "gods" for them, sometimes these referred to "supernatural people writ large", as seen in both versions of Clash of the Titans, sometimes as personifications of abstract concepts (such as Janus and Terminus), sometimes as respected ancestors or former leaders (the "deified" Caesars). Sometimes this veneration was essentially as a mark of respect for what the entity stood for, sometimes as a request for intervention (or staying the heck away), sometimes as little more than just what we always do, sometimes as an excuse for a party.

Each of these sub-systems of veneration was bundled up as a cult, as in the meaning of a mini-religion. Some cults had heirarchies of priests, some had individual temples, nearly all had shrines of some kind.

(Cont.)


At the time this podcast talks about, the Eastern religious practices, particularly the mystery religions, were coming to the fore against this kind of veneration, and each of these practices, whether ascetic meditation, transcendental hedonism or, as the Romans misunderstood it, ritual symbolic cannibalism, was recognised by Romans as another cult, like their own, but you know, oriental and weird.

But cult doesn't have the modern pejorative meaning of a sinister, possibly brain washing, organisation led by charismatic hucksters with a messiah complex. You can probably mentally substitute any one of a number of words, such as practice, tradition or church, for the word cult, and have a pretty good picture of how the Romans would have used the word cult, and how it's used here.

Also, it's interesting to note that the modern "politically correct" word for what most people call cults in the 21st Centruy is simply New Religious Movement. If the ancient word "cult" is a good match for how Romans saw Christianity, then "NRM" is a VERY good match for how they viewed the mystery religions coming in from the East.

So when Mike calls Christianity a cult... well, that's what it was. Don't blame Mike for the word Cult not meaning what many people think it means.

PS Someone once tried to convince me that you classify a faith movement by size as one of (decreasing in size) faith, religion, movement, church, practice, sect, cult and crazy guy on the street shouting at the dogs in his head. I think he was trying to sell something.

Do you intend to add 058 through 084 to the RSS feed Mike?

"Inequality that would make Ayn Rand blush..."

Now that's the sort of thing that keeps me listening every week. Great episode. I really appreciate the look at Empirical society after going through the important events from the fall of the Republic to the mid 2nd century. I always felt that the fall of the Republic was tragic for Roman society, despite the corruption and relative inequality of republican Rome. It seems like a depressing comment on how great wealth and power utlimately corrupt people's values.

I have to say you painted a pretty bleak picture of Imperial Rome, even for the relatively rich life seemed a real drag.

The Republic looks positively rosy now!

Nice episode. Just when i was beginning to get annoyed by the unanswered questions about roman life on the daily basis. Thanks a lot, its a great show, beats television ten times haha. It really makes my day.

It's funny that you mention episode 28 in these episode because it is still missing from the itunes library. That one is important.Also, is there any way to make the episodes appear orderly in the library, it's a real rollercouster in there.

Yes, but my query is to whether Mike will continue to re-submit the episodes from 58 to 83 with a leading '0' as he has done with episodes 001 to 057 (minus episode 28).  Of course I have all the episodes, but am waiting to see if I should rename the existing episodes from 58 to 83 with a leading 0, or whether Mike is going to resubmit them also.

@Antony If your slaves are intelligent or they have children who are intelligent, you could train them. Cato the Elder had a nice little business educating and training slaves and them selling them for a profit as doctors, secretaries, whatever.

If you have an education but are poor, you could sell yourself as a slave. Money goes to your family, and hopefully you get a master who has invested enough in you or needs your services enough to treat you well.

Also of course, being educated doesn't stop you from being on the wrong side in a war. You're a Parthian doctor who knows enough Greek to get by and the Romans capture your town. Hey presto, you're a slave but maybe you can treat your master's gout or whatever with a good diet.

-Actually what she hated more was people who did not earn money taking it from those who did.  She would have been appalled with the whole Roman system.  No economic freedom, no real form of private property (except for the wealthy)and no social/economic mobility.  She grew up in the Soviet Union, where the political elites kept all of the money that they did not earn.  Was Rome really so different?  Let's not pretend that Rome was in anyway a free market society.

hey hey!

Long Time listener, first time poster...

For those of us with a deep interest in city planning (who doesn't?), it would be fun to go through the ins and outs of Roman engineering methods (civil and structural) and the use of concrete.

I thought your attention to Roman tactics and the military structure were outstanding, and provided insight into the novel form of thinking in the Republic.  Do you plan to do so again with the further evolutions of the Roman Army in the late Empire?  Specifically the heavy use of mercenaries and auxillaries...wink wink nudge nudge Flavius Vegetius...

Personally, I'd like to know your thoughts on the HBO Rome series.  Accurate?  Sensational?

All told, you are on the right track.  Informative, insightful, and well-paced.

Hey Mike!

I have a few questions about legionary tactics I haven't been able to solve. The sources I have researched were never really clear on the subject.

1) The checkerboard formation. I've read in several sources that the legions deployed in a checkerboard formation where the second line covers the gaps of the first line. However this doesn't make sense to me. Why not deploy a full straight line with not gaps? I have read somewhere, I forgot where, that the checkerboard formation was used to advance onto the opponent, and when they got close enough they would form a full uninterupted line. So here's my question. How was the checkerboard formation used and what purpose did it have? What advantage does it have over a full uninterupted line?

2) In a documentary on the history channel I have seen an episode on Boudica. There they illustrated how Suetonius had this rotation system in his army which would prevent the first rank of the unit from tiring. A signal would be given whereon soldiers of the first rank would go back to the last rank, and where the soldiers on the second rank would take the place of the first rank soldiers that have just retired to the last rank.

If you look at the first episode of the HBO Rome series, you will see a battle when Lucius Vorenus blows a whistle to let the first rank retreat.

My question is the following. Did this system really exist? It seems very impractical, I imagine the opponent striking an easy blow when the first legionary turns to be replaced. If it existed, what signal did they use?

You would ease my mind if you manage to solve those questions for me Mike.

Thank you for the amazing show!

Oh I could think of so many things!  Here's a little list I'm interested in:

1. A presentation, or debate, of what really killed the empire.  Did it really die at all?
2. The life of the common Roman, not those of senatorial rank. What kind of jobs did they hold? Where did they live and what was that like?  Education?
3. What the heck did Romans do for fun?
4. Rome's greatest inventions (military, scientific, or otherwise).
5. Roman influence on the provinces and tribes, and vice versa - tribal and provincial influence on the Romans.  Maybe a discussion of some of the mystery cults that Romans participated in.
6. The arts - music, poetry/literature, drama.
7. And, maybe going off of what Lieven says above, a debunking of popular movies or books on Rome. The HBO series "Rome" definitely comes to mind, as does "I, Claudius" and "The Gladiator."  Did this stuff really happen?  How is our modern perception of Ancient Rome different from the real Rome?

That's all for now!!

Mike,
something that has always fascinated me is the fall of the empire in the west, specifically, though, about the Senate. i know the senate continued well past the "fall" of the empire in the west, but do we actually know when it officially dissolved, or what they were doing in those years after the fall of the empire?

also pertaining to the senate:

how were senators actually elected? I know this is a very general question but ive never really seen it covered, and i probably should know the answer, but anyway, did the general populace elect them? did they have 'campaigns' like we do? how was one elected to Consul or Quaestor or any of those positions apart from the main body of the senate?

and perhaps most importantly, how would i go about running for Consul if i moved to Rome today?

Mike,
   Great podcast. I know you've addressed it already, but I'd love if you'd reconsider continuing the History of Rome past 476 AD. As we can see, you have a huge fan base and it would be a shame to see this whole thing end, especially with much more story to tell. There's great emperors (Justinian), great generals (Belisarius), terrible emperors (Julian the Apostate), and enough intrigue to, well, coin the term "Byzantine." I know there'd be overlap with Lars Brownworth's podcast, but there's plenty more story to tell. Besides, he'd be a great guest for a portion of the show. With an extended podcast, we get the final defeat of the Parthians, the reconquest of Italy, the rise of Islam, greek fire, Crusades, etc. Most importantly, you get a much better ending to a great podcast. Stopping at 476, we get the pretty sad demise of Augustulus. Continuing to Constantine XI, we end on a legendary last stand made by a heroic emperor.
   Thanks and keep up the great work!

Hey Mike, big fan of the podcast, just caught up last week (very sad about not getting to plow through three new episodes a day).

Anyway, I've wondered for a long time about how much Latin influenced languages that hail from areas conquered or influenced by the Roman Empire. For example, why is English not a "romance language" like French or Spanish? Was it really more influenced by Germanic languages?

Thanks so much for the podcast, I would be doing far better in a "History of Rome" class than I am doing in my current U.S. History class.

Big fan here.  Nthing the suggestions that you make an episode about a day in the life of the average Roman citizen.  A tiny handful of people controlled the vast majority of Roman power, and the podcast has been dealing almost exclusively with these people.

As someone who didn't know much Roman history prior to listening to the podcast, I tend to draw blanks when trying to envision what Rome (the city) was like for an everyday citizen.  I'm particularly interested in urban citizens because soldiers and farmers seem fairly self-explanatory.

I want to know more about Roman philosophy. A show or two about the epicurians and stoics and the rest would be a refreshing change of pace from the current formula of describing one leader's life after another.

Along those lines, maybe taking some time to talk about some of the other great figures in Roman life and history which weren't necessarily leaders would be nice. We got a little of that in the mentions of Apollodorus, but he was still just a background figure in the story of Hadrian. I think a history of someone like Ovid or Philo would be great.

Love, love, love, love the podcast.

My first introduction to the Romans was the movie  Spartacus.  What was yours?

Why are you so enamored with the Romans?  I never could describe it myself

Why does Rome still conquer our imagination?

More things I'd love to hear about:
1) I second the request for more about religion
2) Since I started with Spartacus, and since the collesium is so synonymous with Rome, a podcast about the games would be great!
3) I have a BA in philosophy, so I'm very well read on the hellenistic philosophers, and I think that'd be a great podcast.

Yes, I'm just trying to give you episode topics so it'll continue after the fall of rome.  Though I think that makes me a bad stoic.

Mike The period of Roman dominance is so vast in human terms that even now I struggle to comprehend its timescale. Their impact on our civilization is huge. When they left the west, it plunged into darkness.

I read an article stating that Agricola's retreating roman fort builders in the scottish Highlands buried thousands of nails to keep them from the caledonians, these nails are now being studied by scientists involved in atomic waste storage for the results of long term iron degradation.

Anyways boring as it may seem Roman construction methods are always fascinating to me. Particularly being a Tiler, working with marble concrete and mosaics.  Keep up the good work.  You really are the Tacitus of the podcasting world!

What about some of the very early Christian leaders in Rome - especially those who were in leadership roles before the arrival of Peter and after his death during Nero's persecutions?

Also what are some of your favorite places to visit in Rome and surrounding areas?  Such as favorite restaurants, favorite hangouts, etc.

I have a question about the audible.com sponsorship.  Did they pay you a flat fee for the plug or do they pay you per listener?

The amount you get isn't any of my business (whatever it is you deserve more), but I've always wondered how the sponsorship works.

So, do I have this right that, essentially from the end of the Kings, that no ruler was allowed simply to pass the throne on to a son, and that through the whole long imperial period a successor who was not a blood relation had to be chosen?
This seems remarkable given the opposite obsession in the succeeding imperial states(from the medieval period on anyway....I'm thinking of Henry the VIII for example.....).
If that's so, it seems remarkable that more is not made of it, seeing as how European rulers always wanted to style themselves as the new Rome.

Let people vote on theior favourite character from Rome?  Who has listened to your podcasts the most?  According to iTunes I am on for 25 listens for some of the episodes :-).

Two things:  One...PLEASE CONTINUE after the Fall.  I've listened to Lars and, while good, its far too broad.  Or maybe just continue up to Justinian?

Second:  Could you discuss the small changes, like clothing styles, that occurred during the German migration of the 5th/6th centuries?  How did the system of information fall apart EXACTLY.  When did people stop wearing togas? and the like.  I feel like I'm jumping the gun here as you are far away from this point, but thought I'd ask. You are wonderful my friend!

It seems like when people talk about decline of Rome, the most weighty, solid circumstance is the inheritance of imperial title by a son or a close relative of the emperor. It really seems like emperors who were picked out of a larger body of senatorial / top executive ranks did much better on the whole. Was there any attempt to codify a simple rule of thumb barring close imperial family from ascension or at least strongly discouraging this practice?

Given we're more or less up to the right point in the running for Marcus ("you may have seen me in such films as Gladiator") Aurelius, and in light of the above comments about Spartacus and HBO's Rome, if you had any interest in doing an episode about depictions of Rome in film and media, the 100th episode would seem a sensible juncture at which to do it.

Hi Mike

Just wanted to give my opinion on the 100th episode and maybe a suggestion on the final episode whenever you choose to finish up.

For the 100th episode:
1.) Debunking popular myths
2.) Rome's contact and relations with outsiders i.e from Hibernia (as I hail from Ireland) or Scandinavia
3.) Roman military technology
4.) Your thoughts on HBOs' Rome, I Claudius, Gladiator, Spartacus etc in terms of historical accuracy

For the final episode maybe your own theory on why the Western Roman Empire fell after all the studying you have done and will do it would be great to get your own insight!

And to fellow listeners I recommend Terry Jones' Barbarians (which you can catch on YouTube) for an alternative look at Rome from the point of view of the Barbarians!

Thank you for a great Podcast
Ken

I'd like to second a couple other questions people have asked:

from jacob ptak: "how were senators actually elected?... did the general populace elect them? did they have 'campaigns' like we do? how was one elected to Consul or Quaestor or any of those positions apart from the main body of the senate?"

from ken: "2.) Rome's contact and relations with outsiders i.e from Hibernia (as I hail from Ireland) or Scandinavia"

I happened to read the wikipedia page on Roman contact with China (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino_roman_relations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino_roman_relations</a> ), and found it interesting.  I'd love to hear some more on this subject, though from that article it sounds like there isn't that much known.  But since the current time period seems to have the first recorded case of actual official diplomatic contact between the two, I'd love to hear more about it.

Ok here's an idea! What are all the inaccuracies in the more famous films and TV shows about Roman history, the "added for dramatic effect" or "filled in 'cos we don't really know" or "blatant mistelling" and the less obvious "misdated, misquoted, and mismatched". Your series is a real gem and as a publication...well, it would be a song of a book!

Great podcast.

One question that has always fascinated me is the interaction of the Roman world with the greater world and here I am specifically focusing on the ancient civilizations in Asia.

I know there were many trade links (Silk Route) but what was the knowledge in Rome of places like India and China? Where there expeditions sent? Direct diplomatic links? I have heard stories/rumors of stranded Roman soldiers in the Far East fighting as mercenaries for China. A brief expansion on this topic would be interesting.

The thing is that Justinian and furthermore - Belisarius (wow, what a great patriot, man, general and public servant) I fear will not be addressed. Perhaps an episode of the greatest Roman Generals would be best... I don't know...

quick question: Julius Caesar added a bunch of gallic leaders to the ranks of the senate, swelling their numbers to 1000 or so.

Did the Senate ever revert back to a smaller body, and did they purge the non-Roman/Italian members after Caesar's assassination? When and how? Was it by Imperial decree, or perhaps a dutiful Censor?

How did the roman empire hold together as long as it did ? Why did it not fall to pieces with the death of Tiberias, or in the year of the four emperors or at any of the other precipi that you document. What was the glue holding the empire together ? The empire does not seem to be based on a natural geographical division (like egypt or china). The beauracracy was composed of slaves & freedmen dependendent on the emperor (unlike china). There was no standard means of succession.
It seems to me teethe empire should have fallen apart under a weak emperor or during a succession crisis as the only thing holding the empire together was the emperor.

I have a question I've been meaning to ask for a while.

In one of the Augustan episodes you mentioned that after Augustus' victory no descendent of Mark Antony was allowed to use that name again, but in the Year of the Four Emperors there was a "Marcus Antonius Primus" supporting Vespasian in his conquest of Italy.

What happened here? Is this Marcus Antonius related to the more famous one?

Hey Mike, I've been listening since the seven kings of Rome episodes, and have checked in every weekend for new episodes, even during your hiatus!  Anyway, my questions pertain to your personal opinions on some of the emperors.

In the episodes on Claudius, you told us that you would include him in your top ten greatest emperors.  You mentioned some other emperors you would include, but I'd be interested to know how your own top ten actually shakes out.  If you have any honorable mentions as well, please, let us know.

On the same note, I'd also be interested to know who you think the most effective emperors were.  I have a feeling Domitian might make your most effective list, while he certainly would not make your "greatest."

Thanks for all the hours of historical fun, and though I haven't been able to donate anything yet, as soon as I get a full-time job I will send something your way.

Best!

What did they eat?  How did they heat their homes?  What kind of clothing did they wear?  How did they get around a town the size of Rome?  How did the life of the average Roman change over time?  Was life in 300AD roughly the same as it was in 200BC?

@ Evan

Difference between 'effective' and 'greatest' is a great place to start thinking about how Emporers were viewed and their actions reported. Who controls history is a running theme through this series and is one of the fantastic things about THOR.

It may be too big as a question or an episode but I would love to hear Mike do a literature review on his sources. I know that this has been threaded through the story telling and a critical reflection on the sources has taken place as they relate to the 'facts' of events. I would love to hear how they interacted as texts, how the style of one ancient historian might have affected the style and 'fact finding' of another. If Gibbons drew them all together to produce his thesis for modern readers/historians to start from, who did this for the Romans.

Mike has done a wonderful job of giving us the sources but I guess my question would be, did how Polybius wrote history affect the way Seutonis wrote history? Did the histography change over time and if so how?

I think your 100th episode should be on Cicero. Cicero's writing has been such a valuable resource in the study of Ancient Rome and it has largely helped to shape the modern understanding of Rome. Through his writings Cicero has left a great impression of Roman beliefs and ideals.

Other good topics could include your top 5 craziest emperors, Juvenal and his satires, or Roman Architecture which was one of their crowning achievements and lasting testaments.

I have always been intrigued by western martial traditions.  Granted there isnt much on it outside of the SCA (and all that would imply...) but I have read the occasional good book about it, notably Chris Amberger's The Secret History of the Sword.

I am interested in the training regimen of the Roman gladiators and how it compares to the training received by Roman troops.  I know that there were distinct fighting styles, and Amberger's book touches on it briefly, but not at any great length.  I was wondering how much information is out there...

Maybe I'm reading this wrong. But in terms of greatness of Roman emperors, I would argue that Trejan is a greater ruler (thus far in your narration) than even Augustus. Here was a man not shy to mix in when it came to waging war and standing with his troops (unlike our dear friend Octavian) while also exhibiting great statesmanship. I know I'm going to stir up a hornets nest with this statement but just thought I would make things a bit interesting!! I love your podcast. Without it, my knowledge of Roman history started and ended with a Shakesperean Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony.

Mike,

I would like some information on the marriage of Roman religion (legends, myths, and realities) with the rising tide of Christian Philosophy of that time. A religion professor of mine liked to teach that the Greeks altered the Christian philosophy more than the Christians altered the Greeks. That may be true for the Orthodox Church, but is that true for the Catholic Church? The reason why I ask is 1) religion was darned important to the Romans (and many cultures in the world today) and 2) I'd like to know how much of the Catholic Church is Roman. Pontifex Maximus anyone?

Archery?

I think the only time that archers were ever mentioned in any of the episodes is when the Romans were fighting in the mounted archers of the Numidian cavalry. The maps of battles also contain "the infantry" and "the cavalry" but never "the archers." It always seemed to be a serious tactical error.

Did the Romans simply not employ them? Were their tactics not compatible with archers? Or were archers just included in with the cavalry and infantry but not a separate units?

I'll throw my lot in with those that would like to hear more about daily Roman life for the average Joe. Simple things, like did they have glass in their windows?

Also, just finished Harris' novel "imperium" about Cicero's election to consul. It goes into great detail about the voting process and would be interested in your take on its accuracy.

Excellent podcast!

Hi Mike,

I have so many questions, both about Rome itself, and about your podcasting process:

Rome:
a) Can you tell us more about the Vestal Virgins? How politically important were they, and how did they fit with the other priesthoods of Rome?
b) When did Latin officially "die" as a language? Do we have any record of who the last native speaker of Latin was?

Podcasting:
a) How long does it take you to research a week's worth of reading material? Do you keep a personal library of favoured first-hand sources, like Tacitus or Suetonius?
b) Do you type out ever last word you intend to read, including the asides, and then just read it aloud, or do you keep a simple point-form list of talking notes and then use those as a way to jog your memory when you talk?
c) How long does it take you to record a single podcast?
d) What recording equipment do you use?

You once joked that if Hannibal had won you'd be making The History of Carthage. On that note, I think single episodes dedicated to "The History of Parthia" and "The History of the Germans" would be useful.

What was life like in the Parthian Empire? I understand it's a successor state from Alexander's collapsed conquests. How Greek was it, and how much did it resemble earlier Persian empires? What were their politics and rulers like? What were their foreign policy goals? Did they hope to nibble away at Roman border regions, or did they hope to destroy Rome? What other enemies and allies did they have? How well did they understand Rome?

There really isn't much popular history about the Parthians so I'd love to hear more about them. But as a long time listener I enjoy just about everything you podcast.

A few things for the 100th episode:

1. Discussion on if any family lines have been traced to modern day, such as Caesar?

2. Maybe some detailed discussion on the ahuthors of your source material such as Suetonius, an understanding of their bias's or not in their writings?

Keep up the great work and can't wait to ask questions for number 200. :-)

Hi Mike, what about a bit of a comparison of the mind set of an educated Roman citizen from this golden period of the Empire, and a typical American (or Italian!) of today? I know in some ways people are the same everywhere and everytime, and I know that in terms of education and sophistication a well-off Roman was probably more refined than a lot of modern people, but on the other hand there must have been areas where there would be just a total disconnect if Maximum Typicallus Romanum sat down to have a conversation with you or me today - things like the assumed value of life, status of women, the concept of god(s), family versus society, attitude to work versus pleasure, and so on. So in summary, in what ways did they just think differently than we do?

I would love to hear an episode on how these things were made possible. Technological advancements like hydraulic cement, social factors like the role of slavery and craftsmen in Rome and in the provinces and the engineering specialists in the army.
Thanks for the great podcast. You really know your stuff and how to spin a compelling narrative!

Hello Mike,
I have a very specific question regarding the young Julius Caesar and his holding of the Flamen Dialis. From what I know about Caesar, it seems impossible that he wouldn't have been, by the age of 15 or 16, an extremely ambitious and capable young man. His appointment to this priesthood (by, I assume, Cinna?) must have been an unbelievably cruel blow for Caesar. It's impossible to know whether the motive for this was intentionally spiteful or just unintentionally inconsiderate of a minor's feelings. But what I don't understand is why, considering Sulla's natural enmity for Caesar's uncle Marius and father-in-law Cinna, he nullified Caesar's priesthood. It seems like the absolute greatest favor anyone could have done for Caesar at that point. Unless it was simply to clear the way to proscribe him. Is that your sense of what happened? I realize there must have been so much more going on among these figures than we'll ever know (their relationships to one another outside of the historical records, the events that led up to Sulla's pardoning him, and so on). It's incredibly ironic, though, that Sulla would have paved the way for Caesar's subsequent political and military career (not to mention his being elected Pontifex Maximus, which saved his bacon later on). I was astounded while reading Goldsworthy's bio of Caesar that he seemed to completely miss the significance of the post of Flamen Dialis for Caesar. Are there any primary sources that shed more light on why he was saddled with the flaminate in the first place or more about Sulla's relationship with Caesar, his aunt Julia, or mother Aurelia? I'd read somewhere that Sulla's first wife was a Julia, but not specifically from which branch of the family. Do you know if that's true?

Great podcast, by the way. I've been listening from the beginning and enjoy it more every week.

Thanks,
Alex

Great podcast, thanks.
I'd be interested in your thoughts about why the Roman Republic/Empire lasted as long as it did.  Sort of stepping back from the history of the individual leaders and taking a longer view.  What with all the civil wars, external wars, bad leaders, etc., it's a bit of a mystery to me why it didn't implode a lot sooner than it did.  What were it's great advantages vis a vis it's neighbors? the technology/engineering? the military tactics or weaponry? luck? the political system?  geography? What gave Rome the great advantage over it's neighbors?

I remember some of the early episodes that dealt with Roman military tactics.  I would love to hear a new episode on how the Roman legions have evolved since the early days and how they deal with the threats from the Germanic tribes, Dacians etc.  I always thought the opening battle scene from Gladiator was spectacular and would love to hear more in depth about the tactics, war machines and other weapons.

There has been some discussion on the make-up of the Roman military, but I was wondering if you could go into some more depth. For instance, when an army is said to be 100,000 strong, does that mean 100,000 foot soldiers, or are there a vast number more categories that go into that number; i.e. were the "camp followers" incorporated into the army number?  Also, we know the general infantry structure, but did the Romans actually employ archers and artillery as much as Hollywood has depicted, or was it really just infantry and cavalry with the occasional siege construction?

Hey,
I know someone already asked you these and i also know that you have already answered but it's been a while and you can't really blame us for hopping for you to have a chance of heart. Is there any chance you would continue the history of the roman empire to the fall of Constantinople?? It's a really interesting story to tell plus ending with Romulus Augustus is really disheartening, that is no way to end a great story. Ending with Constantin XI is much better, plus the years of byzantine history are of great importance to understand the middle ages and the evolution of the Renaissance.
I know its a lot to ask but hey if you need further motivation to keep these thing going you can always get more sponsors. Im sure that none of us would mind hearing 2 or 3 ads if it means keeping these great podcast on the air.

I was listening to the episodes on Julius Cesar again these weak and couldn't help but noticing a problem when he was going to stand for trial the moment he became a private citizen. At these time thought be was still Pontifex Maximus, these appointment was supposed to be for life, right?? If a every public office in the empire was sacrosanct, how come that his enemies could just set him for trial while he was still Pontifex Maximus?? Or was these office and other priesthoods not sacrosanct like the others??

Something I would LOVE covered:  regarding the fall of the West (no, not another "what caused it")...  Are there any records that show how Romans perceived the fall?  Was transition to dark-ages slow enough generationally that NO Roman individual or family said (or wrote) "My god, we're about to forget about indoor plumbing!!!"?  I'm trying to imagine what current historians would start writing if our *current* western civ started collapsing and I suspect it would happen slow enough that it might go unremarked.

1) In a recent episode you alluded to the macroecononics of the Roman Empire. Is there anything more known about this? Did Roman exports of Olive oil and wine amount to much? Did they even begin to equal the imports of silk and spices from the East?

2) In a related vein, what was the relationship between Rome and the East? We hear about military interactions with Parthia, but what was the relationship during the rest of the time? Was there much cultural exhange? Did individual citizens flow back and forth across the frontier? What did the Romans know about India and China?

3) I don't remember hearing much of anything about the Cimbrian War. What was that all about? What were the long-term effects? (If I missed a show or something I apologize.)

My 1st question is one that been on my mind for a while, so I would like your opinion on it, if not it would be nice to know by the time we get to that stage in the podcast. When do you think the Roman Empire actually ended. Was it when the last Western Emperor Julius Nepos died in 480 or when the last Eastern Emperor diedZeno in 491. Or was it when the Byzantine Empire ended. Or even when the last solo Roman Emperoe died (probably not but it was a thought)or is there another ending.

As Im having a go at making comments  geekgirl's!!!! 1st question is a good one which is - What are the best/worst cinematic portrayals of Roman history/life. Movies... TV... whatever.

Thankyou Mike for the great podcast and hope it keeps going from strength to strength

I think it'd be really fun to spend some time going over the "what-if's" at pivetal moments in Rome.  Maybe try to speculate a few generations down the line had events turned out slightly differently.  For example:

1) what if Hannibal really had sacked/conquered Rome?
2) what if Christianity faded to obsurity at its infancy and never rose beyond a local cult
3) what if the Great Library never burned down?

I'm sure you could come up w/ more fun ideas.  Love the podcast, first time poster.  Amazing, amazing work.

Maybe it would be interesting to explore how Rome saw itself in the world at large? I know that ancient China was aware of a huge empire to its west, they called it Da-Qin (Qin was the name of the first Emperor of China, and Da means "great," so their nickname means "Great Empire"), and it always intrigued me that these huge powers had vague awarenesses of similarly huge societies but knew very little about them.

Alternately, I think it would be both interesting and helpful to do a run-down of the ancient historians, who they were, when they lived, what their biases or writing personalities were like, since like all ancient history the sources are as much a part of the study as the actual history, and seeing where some disagree with one another is interesting. So an outline of how, for instance, Suetonius is a gossip-monger while Tacitus is a thorough cynic, would be fascinating, especially since Im sure some listeners won't have been able to explore the sources themselves.

During the Julio-Claudian period, I'm struck that there were two horrifically awful emperors, Caligula and Nero, at a time when the imperium itself was still quite new.  At that time, I would think it wouldn't be that radical an idea for the Roman political class to ask if they really wanted to vest absolute power in a single man, given that from time to time they were likely to be stuck with a tyrant who could only be removed by assassination.  Why didn't they react to the trauma of terrible early emperors by returning to the republic?

It seems that every great power that has come along since the time of Rome has been compared to Rome. Alright then. In your opinion, what are the parallels between modern America and ancient Rome?
Are we frighteningly alike, about to face an inevitable decline and fall like Rome did?
Or completely different, with the history of Rome being a fascinating story, but having no real relevance to today? Or somewhere between, with very important differences, but some real similarities that we should be seriously concerned about?
I have really enjoyed your excellent podcast, and would like to know what you think about this.

  Hi Mike,
I have a fairly simple question. When visiting Rome, I was struck by the size of windows in Palatine palaces. As autumns and winters can be quite cold in Rome, I started wondering about the temperatures indoors during these seasons. An Italian friend claimed that the Romans knew the technology required to produce glass, hence, the size of windows. It seems quite unlikely that such important knowledge would be lost in Europe after the fall of the Empire. On the other hand, road building, sewers, central heating, all these civilizational acheivements were lost. Could you elaborate on important Roman technological achievements that were abandoned during the Middle Ages?
And thank you very much for a magnificent podcast!
  Nicolas

Hey Mike!

Reasonably long time (7 or so months) listener, first time poster.

Firstly, let me say I think the podcast is fantastic! I've listened to it all the way through several times, and I really enjoy all the moments I forgot about Roman history, and you really make the history come alive, and I actualy look forward to Mondays for the next episode, so thank you for making the podcast :).

My questions are:

What has been your favouite episode to make, and why? And what aspect of the fall of Rome (in the west) are you looking forward to the most to make?

And secondly, could you please go into more detail on your podcast plans after the history of rome sadly ends?

Thanks for your time,

~Snakus Viper

I love the podcast. Keep it up. Here's my question:

Trajan believed the empire needed to expand indefinitely in order to gain more resources. Hadrian worried more about imperial overreach and stopped the expansion. Who was right? Would Rome have survived longer if it had made a more concerted push into Parthia (and hence seize more loot), or should it have stopped its expansion earlier?

Also, given the importance of Roman law on our own legal traditions and Constitution, I thought a feature on Roman law would be a great idea for a future episode.

Thanks so much for this amazing podcast!

2 things I'd like a little more information about, both have been mentioned in other questions.

1- Roman fashion: What do these people look like? I think about the HBO Rome series and Gladiator- does this look pretty much pervade the entire Imperial Era? When I see Byzantine art, there is a much different look- when did the transition take place?

2- I loved the episodes on the phalanx-manipole systems. Was this still widely in place around the Imperial pinnacle? Did its deterioration or its stasis play into the fall of Rome?

Thank you for your outstanding work!

Since movie and TV adaptations of Roman life or events are often dramatized for added effect I thought it would be interesting to pose this question:  Disregarding historical accuracy, what is your favorite movie or television depiction of Rome and its people?  For me it would definitely be I, Claudius for its great acting and storytelling.

So many of your fans have made great suggestions.  I know the 100th episode will be just as great as the other 99.  Thanks so much for your hard work.

My own leanings are toward hearing about your methods. I really want to use your podcasts in my Latin classroom. As part of teaching students internet literacy and how to be critical consumers of information, I would like to hear more about your sources and your methods. Nothing you've said has contradicted what I've heard/read getting a BA in Latin, so I do trust your work, but any specifics on how you create this podcast would be most welcome.

Si vales, valeo as the Romans would say "If you are well, I am well" All best, and will keep listening.

I've been confused about the term "Military Tribune" for some time now. Maybe I'm getting my terms mixed up though.

Back in an early episode on the Republic, you mentioned that a special pseudo-Consul position was created. I thought the name for this was Military Tribune. This position was eventually abandoned.

But then, suddenly, I started to hear about people serving as Military Tribune here and there. In fact, I think Hadrian was mentioned as serving several such tribunates. This is clearly not the same position as the pseudo-Consular on. So what the heck?

Have I just got the names mixed up? Or did we pass over the creation of a new position within the legions?

You should make it about the art of war according to the Romans. All their history is center in first and foremost on their military successes. So it would make sense to further comprehend, not just the way they made war, but what it mend in a deeper way

Big, big fan Mike. You are definitely doing Jupiter's Work.

I pose a set of "What if?"s wrt Roman history that you may answer with your more qualified opinion.

1) What if Hannibal won the Second Punic War?
2) What if Spartacus escaped north?
3a) What if Caesar had not been killed?
3b) What if Antony won the Battle of Actium (assuming Caesar is dead)?
4) What if the Romans made Carthaginian-like advances in seafaring?

Again, happy 100 episodes and thank you for all your excellent podcasts.

Mr. History of Rome,
Love the podcast.  I look forward to each episode.

I'm curious about the cult and worship of emperors as it compares to early Christianity, particularly language in the first chapters in the book of Revelation.  I've heard this is similar to language that the language the emperors would use when they would address groups of people at their games.  Perhaps some clarity in that.

Another question is that of Herod the Great and his wealth compared to Rome and his relationship with Caesar.  I know it's a bit off topic looking at palestine history, but it may fit in the "governor profile" episode.

Keep up the good work!

2. While doing the research, what was (so far) your most enjoyable part of the History? and what was the worst part?
3. Who are your top 5 (or 7!) roman emperors?
4. Have u read 'Imperium' and 'Lustrum' by Harris? What do you think of these novels?
5. Would you agree the last 50 years of the Roman Republic contain the most number iconic characters: Caesar, Cleopatra, Augustus, Cato, Cicero, Pompey, Mark Anthony, Agrippa and many others?

Mike,

Can you please examine some of the arguments of the "Roman Empire" equals "American Empire" argument.  Tom Madden's book "Empires of Trust: How Rome Built--and America Is Building--a New World" lays out a heavy-duty, neo-conservative argument that Rome arose as an empire because it was a trusted plain-dealer in international relations, that Early Republic Rome did not ppursue territorial expansion, but stumbled into it, and conducted fair international relations with it allies and peaceful neighbors.  I find this all a bit difficult to swallow, as it seems to be a revisionist way to rationalize American hegemony of the Roman variety.  I really want someone to attack these arguments.  Let my question be your causus belli.

Hi Mike,

Let me add to the chorus of thanks for the great work you are doing. I have really enjoyed the podcast from its early days, and have listened to each episode at least twice if not more. Simply the best podcast out there.

Right. Questions:

1. Do you prefer reading and talking about any particular phase of Roman history especially more than the rest? Since you are clearly a Romanophile, do you prefer the periods of Roman history where they are in ascendency rather than decline? Put another way, if you had to live in a particular period of Roman history, Gibbon nothwithstanding, which would you choose?

2. What do you think of Robert Harris' books? Pompeii is older and not bad at all, but I really enjoyed 'Imperium' - the first in a 3 part series about the life of Cicero. To me it seems historically very accurate - the portrayals of Pompeii, Crassus and Caesar seem spot on. And the story is very engaging. I'm looking forward to the next in series which has been just released. Ever thought about dabbling in a bit of historical fiction?

Finally, I understand if you call it a day in 473AD - to take a break from podcasting or to write a book - whatever you choose. However, in the event that you choose to continue into the Byzantine era - you will have continue to have one dedicated listener in me.

All good wishes,

-----

Mike,

I would love to know what you think about contemporary media representations of Rome.  I am talking about recent movies like Gladiator and TV shows like Rome and Spartacus or even older movies like Ben Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus (1960).    Do you find them annoying or difficult to endure because of historical inaccuracies or do you like them because they at least present something related to Rome? (Along with the possibility of peaking viewer’s interest in researching more of the real story)

Also, what is your opinion on the documentaries that are shown on The History channel and Discovery Channel?  It seems that most take the position that the viewer so naive on the subject that everything is presented at a very high level and as a consequence it is difficult to get any real interesting details.  (Of course I watch because something on Rome is better than nothing.)  I guess that is a good thing for you as it gives all of us a reason to download the podcast every week.

Thanks for all the work you put into this.

Western thought is brought to you by the Greeks, Romans, and Vatican (I know, some incidental influence by the East & Alexandria), however, at what "Roman time period" would you say that we are most closely related to now, culturally? Violence is everywhere, our friends are text messages and facebook, or is that just the media? Do we actually care for our neighbor?
Do we care about God? architecture? Is history repeating?

Hi Mike
I know I have already asked 2 questions (sorry about the typo's, I try better this time), but if I may I've got 2 others.
1. It would be nice to here more about sport in the roman times. I know you mentioned very briefly about it in the Nero episodes and in passing about the various games held. Did Rome's sport life just involve random gladitor games, letting "enemies of the state etc" in with the lions and some chariot races put in for good measure, or did they have a bit more to those things or did they have organised contest's like we do today like the FA Cup or the Super Bowl etc.
I have heard they carried on the Olympic Games for a bit from greece, but was that just something to keep the greeks happy or was serious thing or even military training.
So in short was sport just for the gladitors and military training or was there more to it (like leagues or Boxing belts etc)?

2. Who are your top 10 Roman's and worse 10 Roman's and why? (if you want to keep to just Emporers or Generals I will be happy with that as well)

Thanks for the great podcast and hope it dosn't take you the next 100 podcasts to 200 answer all the questions

My question, what were some famous Roman explores? Or what did they know about the world as it actually was? I heard something about how Roman coins have been found in India, and how it was odd the Romans never sent an ambassador to Han China. There is of course always rumors that they knew about the Americas and other places around the globe. I was just wonder if you could briefly comment on Roman explores and their knolwege of other places in other words :D

Thanks love the show.

PS I am also curious to know what they thought of the Persians and vis a versa.

Rome, Persia, China and Axum - All four were grand empires around the same time. All four traded amongst each other. However, we only ever really hear about Rome and China; Persia and Axum are mostly footnotes in the stories of the other empires or smaller, separate histories by themselves. There has to be something cool to be said about an age of four great empires!

Hi Mike
As an architect, I want to reinforce the idea of an episode about the engineering behind/under/around the empire. I completely concur with the comment about the early episodes on the legion. They helped me frame thinking on episodes down the line. Engineering and planning also fell into place after the legions were done with their pacification (sic) duties.

Another thought, maybe a recap on the transition of politics over the centuries...

thanks for all of your efforts.

Mike, great podcast! I am a long time listener and this is my first post. A question that I have regards Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Gibbon makes the assertion that the Roman Empire's decline is the result of the embrace of Christianity. Essentially, the widespread acceptance of the tenets of Christianity lead to a weakoning of the martial spirit and hence the empire's decline. What is your take on this?

Two suggestions:
- For the potential tourist: a 10 day tour of the best or most significant Roman sites in Great Britain.
- Some more extra-biblical details on the Roman characters and associated officials in the Bible - the Herods, Pontius Pilate, Felix and Drusilla, Porcius Festus, King Agrippa and Bernice.

Hey Mike i love your show and i was wondering Rome had presevered tradional values with the threat of Carathage which created a common enemy and which allowed Rome to stay together in hard times. when Roman emperors wanted to find a enemy that offered a real challenge why not steam roll partha which i think was the only army that on a even playing field could offer a real challenge
my second question if this is allowed is more of a question to do with the podcast in general, i understand that you aren't going to go into the eastern empire's history and i understand they are very different but instead why don't you go back and add episodes that touch on certain aspects of Romes life like your early christmas-saturiala episode and the history of the roman wedding which i think would satify everyone
1 you keep making a podcast which i think is a important part of your life mabye?
2 all your fans will be able to keep this podcast which is wonderful
3 the money coming your way can't be all bad either!!

Possible questions:

1) Roman time- time is of course an illusion, but I think it might be interesting to investigate the Roman calender and clock, which I understand had variable hours which appear on Prague's famous Orloj.

2) Roman currency - how was it denominated and used?

3) Roman beyond the Empire - I don't just mean just over the border, but the relations of Rome with the other ancient societies of India and China.

Like several others here I have seen the tv series "Rome" which I really enjoyed, and am currently watching "Spartacus-Blood and Sand" much of which still shocks me.  Whilst I know they didn't use the same profanities we do, did they say those kinds of things...  the language can be quite filthy, as are some of the behaviour shown, such as the terrible cruelty ...  If anything in this show is accurate it doesn't enable me to think very highly of these people.

Hi Mike! Been listening to the show since the start and absolutely love it. Cheers for putting in the time and effort to produce such a comprehensive and enjoyable podcast.

I've always had a big question around the the distinctive Roman military armour - the "Lorica Segmentata" and the Roman Legionary style helmet. How long were they used for and why did they go out of fashion (never to be used by anyone else)? The armour looks like a pretty good piece of kit and so it seems strange that it had a limited shelf life.

Thanks mate,

Sean (From Bristol, England)

How about a discussion of surprising vestiges of Roman culture and organization that still exist today?  We all know that many countries have senates, law in many countries remains influenced to varying degrees by Roman law, and that the Pope holds a title once held by Julius Caesar, not to mention so much vocabulary in English and other languages derived from Latin.

But what are some of the surprising connections between then and now that you've discovered that most people wouldn't know about?

I second Traci Nielsen's suggestion of Roman concrete-making--it sounds intriguing. And maybe other Roman inventions or engineering skills that were lost.

I would like to know if you will somehow get the early episodes on Itunes even if they are for pay.

The early episodes are totally "classic,"- they are legend! I can't Download any new episodes because I don't want to lost the old ones and can't reset to a new computer because I do not want to lose the early episodes!

Help us preserve those greatest hits! Please get itunes to get them on!

First: Thank you Mike.  Second: I know I missed the 100th ep deadline but I'm writing anyway.  Hope springs eternal.  Finally, here's my question...

How do scholars translate dates from the Roman calendar which supposedly hangs on the mythological founding of Rome, to the BCE/CE (or BC/AD) calendar we use today?  In other words, when we say that Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, what is the peg we hang that on to know what year that was, since our calendar started years later, and even the birth of Jesus upon which it's predicated is now assumed to be off by four years or so.

Thanks again,
Bryan

Hi,
I really enjoy your podcast.

Can you comment on the price of things in ancient rome compared to current times?

For example, how much did a 'pair of shoes' cost in ounces of gold (or other measure).

Thanks,

Mike, I just wanted you to know that my 16 yr old son has listened so avidly to THoR that his parent/teacher conferences  ALL started out with "He sure knows a lot about Rome!"  His English teacher even asked him to teach an entire day of her classes for her when they get to Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" play, to give all her classes background information about the man and the time, so everyone can better understand what Shakespeare wrote.  Thanks for such a great podcast!  I know this isn't a question, but I'm glad it's THoR my kids listen to, instead of, say, Marilyn Manson.

What's your take on the suggestions that the Roman use of lead in pipes and containers, especially those used to store condensed wine, wound up seriously affecting Roman brains - and maybe society?

And what surprised you the most about the early Romans?

Hi, I'm a british listener and i've been really enjoying the show.
I think that for the 100th episode you should focus on the roman army. When I say that I mean talking about the equipment, the tactics and fighting styles of the army down to the lives of the everyday soldier.
On another note, are you going to continue with the bzyantine empire? Not to sound pushy but a podcast on Greek and Macedonian history with alexander would be very interesting as well.

I loved this episode. I highly commend you for doing such a great work on making roman history such and easy and digestible subject to understand and take wisdom in the subject. Many times I find myself taking examples about politics and what a good government should and should not be from your podcast. Me, as a historian, love to read about straight monographic subjects, such as your podcast is. Now that you are about to embark on other fields of history you so far neglect, obviously not because of lack of interest, but in space of timing, I thrill at the thought you taking the time to delve on other interesting subjects that makes me eager for next week episode.

As a final note, you may consider, if it is within your interest and time to delve in about further about roman military advancement. You have spoken so far about the legions being first a rabble of warrior, then a greek phalanx , then a maniple with joints, and finally the marian reforms, but yet I know there is much more in it then you let everyone else know, about the way they wage siege war on their enemies fortified positions, the counter siege technologies, such as does of the famous Archimedes way back in the siege of Siracuse, and whatnot.

Also you could talk briefly about medicine, how the aristotelian theory of the humors got around the roman mind when it came to not only medicine, but also as an esoterically way to determine personality and whatnot.

The different rituals and gods women and men prayed in for certain things and occasion you deem worthy of your podcast, such as for child birth, before a battle (auguries), for taking a official bureaucratic post, for good luck and whatever else comes in mind.

All else aside, thanks again for this podcast. Feel free to dismiss any of my suggestions if you feel they are unworthy or not interested in dealing.

Dear Mike

During your 100th episode, or next week's look around the Empire in general, I'd love to find out a little more about the Coliseum and Gladiators.

To my mind the Coliseum is dark side of the Romans, which turns me off of their otherwise amazing civilisation. I hear conflicting opinions and facts about what went on in the arena.

What really happened in there Mike?

Oh, and I love the podcast, as always.

I'm looking forward to Marcus Aurelius's episode. (He is my favourite emperor) I don't know much about history but as a philosophy student I have read his Meditations and it really reflect his character, not just as an emperor but as a human being(You can actually feel the stoic impression in every pages).

Thanks you again for an educated podcast.

I'm not sure if it's the ideal solution, but "The Sound of Young America" got around the expiration of old podcasts by creating a "new" podcast/feed called "The Sound of Young America (Classics)."  Really Old episodes get added to that list, so they don't muck up the current feed.  It works really well.

You could do the same, but then you'd have the hassle of directing new listeners where to get the old episodes.  That's less of an issue with the non-serial TSoYA, but may be more tricky for History of Rome listeners who are more likely to want to start at the beginning and move forward as they have to get them from two places.

Anyway, it's something to consider.  You're not the first to encounter this problem.

I'm curious as to why there are so little records of the Emperors of this time.
I would have though we'd hit a time when Rome is a mature, complex society with a some sort of literary culture.

Were texts burned, or crumbled due to age?

Maybe this is a question for the "100" thread.

"To my mind the Coliseum is dark side of the Romans, which turns me off of their otherwise amazing civilisation. I hear conflicting opinions and facts about what went on in the arena."

I'd think that the pervasive institutionalized slavery and the tendency towards brutal execution methods (ie, crucification) would be a lot greater marks against them.

You're doing a great job Mike, and one of the best things about your podcast versus many others is I don't have to listen to 3-7 minutes of B.S. before you get into the material...

Also, I'm with DB on this comment thread...looking forward to Marcus Aurelius's episode(s)..I was named after the guy and am of old Roman and Belgian (King Leopold) descent...the old stoic is not an easy guy to live up to...

You've also inspired me to form some campaign promises for campaign in Roman terms and ideals...

I love these. These is definitely one of the better podcast out there. I'm serious, i can't tell anymore how many times I've heard the hole series. I really like your job and your story telling stile. Awesome stuff.
Thanks a lot for posting the firsts episodes, it's really an upgrade from those compact versions you had before. I tried to separate them using some audio applications, but the output file was of really creepy quality. So thanks a lot.
One more thing, could you re-post the 28 episodes from 58 to 84?? These so that the episodes will appear in order in iTunes, because that gab there is really annoying when you are trying to hear the hole thing in one run.
Thanks for everything. Your show is the greatest, keep it up.

I've updated my library with your re issued podcasts, but it seems epi 28 'Taking Stock' is missing, for some reason this does not appear in the ITunes list (as of 5 Apl 2010), fortunately I still have my 'old' copy.

Thanks for all your hard work, my interest re awakened I've re read I Claudius, and diped into Suetonius, Tacitus and Plutarch .

Just out of curiosity, are you going to post episode 28? It seems to have gone missing. I love this podcast and want to hear all of it-- I came to it late, and so am just catching up.  Thanks for making something so interesting and fun to listen to!

Thanks for the podcast Mike.  I've always wanted to learn about Rome but didn't know where to start.  This is PERFECT.  I've recommended it to my history-geek friends.

Hi Mike. I've been avidly listening to the podcasts for the past couple of months since I got an iPhone and downloaded the episodes from iTunes (they begin at 40). Is there a way to get the backdated ones on iTunes for the phone, please? I'm probably a bit challenged on the tech front as I'm also sure there's probably a very simple solution! Many thanks for your efforts in bringing us hours of enjoyment and enlightenment! Richard, London, England.

@ robert.

There are 94 episodes released, counting all the multiparts as seperate episodes.

There also is a forum topic for suggestions for the 100th episode. I have no idea if Mike will listen to our suggestions but if you have any you can post them.

First Happy Birthday to you and the Mrs. History of Rome!  As a soon to be licensed architect I appreciate your mentioning Apollodaris (sorry about the mispelling).  However, I don't remember you mentioning one of the most well known architect/engineers possibly of all time, from the Augustan era, during your podcasts, Vitruvius (Marcus Vitruvius Pollio) .  If I missed it and I'm wrong I apologize. De architectura or as its now know The ten books on Architecture, were required reading when I was in college.  I even made one of his machines for a class project.  Just thought he deserved some props, keep up the good work and love your podcasts!

HBD Mr&MrsTHOR!

An short aside on Italian pronunciation:
Mike, you used the very common mispronounciation of the place of Hadrian's Villa outside of Rome. Typically, Italian stresses the second syllable in most, if not all cases, except one: three syllable words like Tivoli. TEE-vo-lee, not tee-VO-lee. The same is true for all other three syllable Italian words (I think....)

Thanks so much for your most excellent work.
(And I think episode 100 is episode 100!)

Hello Mike,
I love your work.

Please tell me, all during your podcast you throw out "exiled from Rome" without comment. But what did that mean throughout the history you present? Certainly "exile from Rome" at 100BC did not mean the same as "exile from Rome" under Hadrian.

Scott

Hello Mike,
very much enjoying your podcasts - thanks so much.
i do have a question though - in relation to Augustus (yes, i still have a lot to get through) - you state that although he introduced the lex julia HE himself was well known for his 'straying'. now, lucky me i live in rome & am studying for an important exam which covers roman history among other things - and as my very studious friend said to me - WHAT IS YOUR SOURCE FOR THIS INFO??? - neither she nor i had ever heard any such thing about augustus - was his self promotion so good that it has lasted down to us?! or is there some juicy gossip we're missing out on?!!!
i thank you in advance for your reply!
and thanks again for the casts - so nice for me to enjoy an english version of this (italians love to complicate!) while i have my cornetti alla crema & cafe latte at the local bar in the morning!

Ave!!!

Also, does anyone have any idea how much Sabina traveled with Hadrian during all his tours of the provinces?

Love the podcast....BW

I really appreciated your treatment of Hadrian's relationship with Antinous. I find sexuality in ancient Rome to be a really fascinating topic. The way you started out saying that homosexuality as a psychological identity was not something the Romans had was well put. When discussing this with colleagues and professors I find it's most accurate to say same-sex sexual contact; it's a mouthful, but otherwise we end up using terms like homosexuality and bisexuality which project our own modern assumptions about sexuality onto the Romans.
Well done and will keep listening

I really have to agree with Valerie here, well done.  It seems as if modern conceptions of sexuality are much more exclusive - we ironically are more likely to pigeon-hole people than the ancients were. I hate the cheap modern explanations of complicated relationships like that of Achilles and Patroclus or Gilgamesh and Enkidu. It really just isn't that simple, and I applaud you for recognizing that in your podcast.

MMM I think this acceptance that the Romans thought same sex was natural doesn't add up to me personally. Ancient societies were desperate for fertility and homosexual are sterile in that respect. It is my true belief that this is vastly overstated in history by modern historians and this doesn't hold water in my view.

Regarding your mention of Simon Bar-Kochva in this episode, as far as I know, he's never referred to as "Simon", but only as "Bar-Kochva".

This is the first time I comment here, and I must say I'm dreading the time I finally catch up, because that means I'll only have one episode a week, instead of a few at a time like now.

I started listening to this after "auditing" Professor Donald Kagan's online course a the Yale website, "Introduction to Ancient Greek History," which ends with the rise of Alexander. THOR makes a good followup for what happened in Europe after the decline of the Greeks.  Thank you for some interesting listening.

Upstream in the supply chain, to make my solar panels and kit, if you think about it, is an alarming trail of waste, mining, manufacturing and energy use, from all over the world. Long before they generate their first unit of clean power in Marlow, my beloved panels have left some sort of trail of pollution behind them. But here’s the deal. It’s not big.

In ball park terms, the upstream damage, the ‘eco-baggage’ that my panels arrived with from day one, amounts to some 1000kg of greenhouse gas equivalent impact. They will pay that back in full within two years.  They will sweep up all their own eco-mess, their footprint in manufacture etc, during the first two years of operation.  Thereafter, for the next 20 years or more, they will be sweeping up other people’s pollution – and fully be in (planetary) credit, increasingly so, asdffor each year they keep on keeping on.

the Expression ״may his bones be Crushed"

is not an Accurate translation, the more correct one will be

"bones erode"(in Relation to the parson) or " may his bones be erode".

Great episode as always Mike.

Also for those that are interested there is story on the Roman aqueduct that was recently found. Apparently it was built during the time of Trajan. More information can be found at the following site.

Jason,

This is what Mike said on this subject: "When it comes to the long term future of the show I want to address the growing number of calls in the comments for me to press on past 476 and cover the Byzantine Empire in full. I don’t want to shut the door on the idea completely (because who knows how I’ll feel when it actually comes time to fish or cut bait), but to be clear: this is probably not going to happen. Not only is the Byzantine Empire outside my comfort zone academically, but I plan on heading back to school after establishing residency in Texas and am skeptical of my ability to keep up the pace of a weekly podcast and knock out a Master’s Degree at the same time. So, like it says it right there in the header: A weekly podcast tracing the history of the Roman Empire, beginning with Aeneas's arrival in Italy and ending (someday) with the exile of Romulus Augustulus, last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire."

Hello - long time listener, first time poster :o)

Just an idea, but when you arrive at the intended ending of the series, it would be interesting to go back and look at the history from a few different perspectives or go into greater detail about certain aspects of Roman life.

For example, the arena has been refered to but it would be interesting to hear a podcasted dedicated to the gladitorial games. A series of 'one-off' podcasts can be done to add depth and understanding to the series, but they would have to be tied to the chronology. What was it like to be a centurion? What was daily life like for a typical pleb? etc. Making history more personal is a wonderfull way of giving context to dates and facts...it bridges the gap between knowing history and understanding it.

What ever you chose to do, I thank you for what you've already done and look forward to supporting any of your future endeavors.

Cheers!

Dear Mr Duncan (awesome name, BTW),

I'm finally caught up with your podcasts (after a very pleasant week's compulsive listening) and I just wanted to say not only does The History of Rome stand head and shoulders above much that's available on iTunes but is better than a great deal that's available commercially. It exemplifies the true potential of the internet (your listeners) are truly blessed that you've given up your time to share what you know with us.

Much love,
Duncan Crowe

I was just looking at past episodes and noticed that you have stopped posting maps of conquests. I' sure we all loved the maps, as I have no idea were Dacia even is. If you could start with the maps again it would be great,

Is there a place to see the show notes?  I'm really interested in digging into Hadrian's history a little deeper and would love to know what the source material was for the last two or three shows.

Also, does anyone have any idea how much Sabina traveled with Hadrian during all his tours of the provinces?

Love the podcast....BW

In anticipation of an exhibit on Hadrian at the British Museum, BBC historian Dan Snow guides an interesting documentary by traveling to Rome, North Africa, Judea, and Egypt to discover the legacy of Hadrian.  This is a fascinating hands-on account.  Go to the BBC Explore YouTube site, and search for "Hadrian" and view the 4 to 5 segments individually.   Enjoy!! - James

Hey Mike,

Delete the comment from your page that just contains a bunch of links and is signed in Japanese or whatever.  It's gotta be some kind of spam.  Didn't click the links to be sure but if the guy could even speak English to listen to the show, he would comment in English and tell us what those links are.  They're probably porn or spyware or something (I'll leave it to someone else to click and prove it one way or another.)

Just trying to help you keep this place safe for people's computers, man.  Love THoR.  Best podcast ever, IMHO.  Keep up the good work.

Hi Mike,

First, let me say I love your podcast and have listened to every episode at least once if not twice. You make my train rides to work not only bearable but enjoyable. I have one request though. I was wondering if it is possible for you to up the volume on the pod. Sometimes I have trouble hearing it and always have to turn the volume all the way up.

Anyway, keep up the great work. I can't wait for the next one.

I've just managed to catch up with all the episodes.  Great podcast so far, keep up the good work!  Even as a graduate with an Ancient History major, I'm learning something new each time.

Regarding Trajan overlooking Hadrian for the succession, is it possible he was hoping for a natural son of his own?  Did he and Pompeia have any children (even daughters)?

Hi Mike,

Is there any way you can add the first 40 episodes to feedburner's RSS xml? I know I can access the raw MP3s by going to the archives page, but I (and many others) just use iTunes' Podcast section to manage their daily listening, and it would be awesome if we could just download the first 40 without having to get each file individually, then importing it into iTunes.

I guess what I'm saying is it would be awesome if iTunes showed all of the original episodes as well as the new ones.

Just a suggestion, thanks for the amazing podcast! Was thinking about going back and listening to the entire thing from day one, but I guess I deleted the older episodes :(

I absolutely love your podcast, and feel that The History of Rome represents the very best of what this medium can offer.

That said, I'm having continuing problems with how iTunes handles this feed.  These problems seem to appear from time to time and definitely get in the way of my enjoying the podcast and getting a regular feed.

For the past several weeks, the episodes after #76 keep disappearing from my iTunes playlist, and when I refresh in iTunes, I can't get to them.  I see 77, 78 etc. here on the Typepad site, but I cannot get them into iTunes.  Obviously I want them in iTunes so that I can listen to them from the iPod and not only while sitting at my computer.

Does anyone else have this problem (iTunes ver. 9 on a Mac)?  If so, any suggested solutions?

@SPUD -  Apple, iTunes, iPods, etc are crap. Get off that wagon buddy and don't be a slave to them. Apple want to monopolise your media consumption and once you're hooked, charge you through the nose for it. Get a cheap and cheerful mp3 player from any other manufacturer and you'll find you're free to download and listen to what you want, when you want!

Just 2 questions for you, did Trajan have any problems with the Praetorian Guard, such as an ambitious Praetorian captain, and why was Trajan so popular with the legions of the empire did he keep up Domitian's pay increase?

Thanks for the Great Podcast

I've been lurking in the background for the last year or so, but I really felt that the time has come to say thank you, Mike, for this great podcast. I usually listen to it while running and since I enjoy running I usually  listen to three episodes per run - a real treat. So this is just to say thank you for being the best possible auditory support for my miles.

I just found your podcast and it's been an incredible experience.  I started with the Cataline Conspiracy and I am up to Nero.  But I just downloaded all the early ones, so I will restart at the beginning.  I have a question, though.  What was the Roman era calendar like? Not the days but how did the mark the years?  It's hard to know that you are in 20 BC without a reference.  And how did historians nail down the years when things occurred?  Thanks for a great podcast and thoroughly entertaining story telling

Hey Keith,
The Romans used the founding of the city as their starting date (753BC for us). This is known as Ab Urbe Conditia (since the founding of the City). Also years were named after the consul's of the year. Varro used that for example to calculate back to the start of The Republic.
You can look it up on wikipedia with it's errors (aut non), but it gives some information.

Greetings,
Nick

I recall from your early mini-series on Caesar Augustus (Octavian), that you took pains to eludidate the difference between modern-day use of the term "emperor or imperator" where princeps was the more precise title.  Yet I feel very lost, or I think I missed somehting that by the time of the Trajan episodes, you mention "throne".  did the princeps evolve into a king of rome (in the sense a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet)?  In other words, when did Rome start having a king by another name, where they were concerned about secession as oposed to elections?

Hey great episode, and well timed to wrap up the year on the dawn of the Roman golden era. I just want to mention to everyone that there's a poll setup on the Forum Gallorum (forumgallorum.freeforums.org) for your pick of the best emperor of the 1st century. It's under History --> Roman History --> Pick a Princep. Right now it's tied between Augustus and Vespasian.

love the podcast.

Wondered if you had given any thought to spending an episode or so on how the various institutions of government were faring under the imperial system. A lot of the early podcasts dealt with the various religious bodies and the senate, but now its more about the emperor as a man (which is great, I hasten to add, but perhaps give a lopsided view of whats going on). What are these institutions getting up to now, what does the senate actually do, etc etc etc.

anyways, just a thought!

Good job Mike. I generally enjoy your effort. Next holiday could you please do a few extra episodes in advance? Now I'll have to go to the movies New Year's Eve! Please, please, whatever you do, don't listen to Dan Carlin; I'd hate for you to be afflicted by warped history disease. I'm reading Cicero's letters and TDAFOTRE (1947 Limited Editions Club) and hope to get started with Tacitus' Annals before classes resume next week.

Maybe because it's so damn easy: Did you notice that there's a link to the mp3 with every episode listed? Let's deliberate whether this has any function.

I've listened to this episode & the two Trajan episodes many times now. They're so informative and I find it encouraging to think & learn about Rome at its apogee rather than its nadir (not that your crisis episodes aren't wonderful, because they are).

First time commentator here: I've been listening to these episodes for a while now and, having studied Roman History at University through Classical Archeology and Anciet History for a couple of years, I find it great. The only critique I might have, is rather a request: sources. There's nothing I'd like to know more than which sources you've used for your episodes. Of course, I know you can't list in each episode who said what, as that'd disturb the flow, but perhaps something on the side? Sources you could recommend?

Beside this request, I've got to say I absolutely love this podcast. I get the same kind of joy at seeing there's a new episode of History of Rome, as I get from seeing there's a new episode of Dexter or some other great TV-show!

So, great props from Denmark - looking forward to new episodes!

Hi, my 15 yr old has been listening to your "History of Rome" podcasts and has been having me get him some of the books you mention. I usually don't balk but, reading the reviews for "Plutarch; Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans," made me think this book wiill be very hard to understand. Since you refer to it, I'm figuring you've read it. Can you tell an uneducated mom which version might be best to get? If it helps, he reads stuff like Plato's Allegory of the Cave, "The Twelve Caesers", and "The Illiad" so I know he reads above my level. I just don't want this book to be too hard for him. If you think it would be, I'd love any other suggestions you might have. By the way, he says your podcasts are great! Thank you for putting them out!

Thank you so much for an excellent few episodes on the Flavians, especially the oft misjudged, and misunderstood Domitian.  It is one of my life missions to help restore Domitian's reputation.  He was not perfect but nowhere near as bad as history has recorded.  What Domitan established was essential for Trajan and Hadrian's later actions, and indeed what these two, and other 'good' emeprors like Augustus, did was similar to Domitian, but where they were praised he was vilified. Thank you for this most excellent of series and for helping Domitian's true place in history to be seen.

Ms. Meyers

I wouldn't worry at all about Plutarch being too difficult for your son. One of the surprising things about the Roman historians is how modern they can come across - most people don't expect that. Gibbon is harder to read than practically any Roman.

The more difficult problem is to find a good edition of Plutarch - many are abridged and chopped into strange parings. I really like the Loeb editions because I am an unabashed dork and they have the Greek printed across the page from the English. I don't even read Greek, but hey, it's still pretty cool. However, they are not cheap. Also, I'd avoid any of the Dryden translations. I don't know if this was helpful or not, but best of luck.

Mike - I continue to enjoy your podcasts. Keep up the great work! Looking forward to the five good emperors.

But that file no longer exists for some reason. The RSS feeds don't reference any new URL and only shows the most recent episode.

So if anyone can get me a copy of the interview (post a link, or send me a copy of it) I would be much obliged. I will me monitoring these comments for the next couple of weeks hoping against hope.
Also, I am going to post this on the next new episode to come out. Which hopefully will be tonight.

Regarding the comments about the BBC interview link, I have found that, for some incomprehensible reason, the BBC has a habit of only holding the current podcast episode available for download. If you don't subscribe to the podcast, hard luck. If I am wrong and anyone has managed to find an archive of previous podcasts somewhere I would be eternally grateful to know where they are.

Ditto.  I am catching up now, which is turning out to be quite a delicious process, after not listening for about 2 months, and I heard about this interview but have apparently no way of obtaining it.

As a rule, BBC podcasts don't maintain archives on Itunes, but I do know that the BBC podcast In Our Times maintains an archive of past episodes on its website, which implies that there is nothing in the organizations protocol which prohibits that practice.  Hence, I blame this individual BBC podcast for this policy, and presumably the people in charge of it are perfectly capable of rectifying the problem.

I was born during the ’80's have never seen the band play live. My love for the band is something that had formed through listening and singing along to their songs I never get tired of listening to. Tipong, this reunion, this 83008, means so much to me, a fan, because, probably, hopefully, this might be my only chance of seeing the greatest band play songs that define my life.

Hey Mike.  A couple episodes back you were commenting on Lars Brownworth and his great Historical podcasts.  I have to say, even though I came to your podcast from "12 Byzantine Rulers" and am currently listening to "Norman Centuries", I think your style, pace, tone and the amount of information you give is better.  Thanks for the great podcast.  Please continue for as long as you can.  It would be perfectly fine with me if you covered the information on Byzantium again, or even focused on what was happening on the West during that time.  Thanks.  -Mike

Hey Mike. Congrats on the marriage, also on moving to Austin, that's a great town. I do believe I found your podcast at around episode 12 and I had already listened to the Byzantine podcasts (and I may have to relisten to them afterwards). When I was in college I took a Classics class for a lark, even though I was introduced to Livy and Plautus, the most fascinating book for me was The Mute Stones Speak: The Story of Archaeology in Italy by Paul MacKendrick. It surprised me how much I liked that book.

Also, to let you know, I took up Audible.com's offer to try them out via your podcast. I chose a (gasp) non-Roman book, Malcolm Gladwell's Blink. Amazing book, one I would highly recommend for people to read or to listen. Mr. Gladwell looks at the phenomenon of how we have "gut instincts" and how it tends to be right alot of times, how we make those snap decisions in a blink of an eye.

Hey Mike,

On the subject of Lars Brownworth, your podcast is by far the superior in terms of depth of research and simple entertainment value. Your output is also far more regular than Lars's and the trickle from Norman Centuries make one wonder if the subject is worth the effort. On the subject of Domitian, Gibbon seems to side with the senatorial propagandists and ranks him along with Caligula and Tiberius. When did the revisionist view to Domitian begin to take sway?

Hi Mike - have been subscribed for 20-odd episodes. Keep it up, you're approaching hero status!

As I listened to Domition's deal with Dacia's King Decebalus, I saw parallel's with the Iran-Contra scandal 20 years back. The war technology given to an enemy eventually coming back to bite the giver...sound familiar? I wondered if you think they are at all the same. Guess time (and President Ahmadinejad) will ultimately tell if history repeats itself.

All the best.

Hey Mike,

Love the podcast as always. I just have a quick question. Toward the end of episode 75 - The Forgotten Son, you mentioned that Domitian traveled quite a bit more than other emperors, taking executive power with him where he went. Were you just introducing talk of his military campaigns or were you leading up to something bigger with that observation?

Mike, you're awesome!  I came to this podcast kind of recently (Sept 09), but I've been a fan of Roman History since reading Gibbons in junior high school, and when I found your podcast it's been a godsend.  I've really enjoyed catching up on all the old episodes.

Any chance you can post a link to your sources, or maybe recommended readings?  I'd love to delve deeper into some areas in particular.  Or you could just write a book, which would have everything in it!  That would be cool.  Thanks for your time and effort on this.

Another great episode Mike!  A suggestion for the THoR community, if you get a chance Anthony Everitt has a new book that came out about a month or 2 ago titled Hadrian and the triumph of Rome.  It begins in the time period Mike's Podcast is currently dealing with and continues until the end of Hadrian's life.  I highly recommend the book.  If any of you have read Everitt's other works you'll love this one.  Keep up the good work Mike! Hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving!

Mike - love your work. I listen to it on my drive to work monday morning.

For those who love this show like I do, please take time to make a donation. Think of it as a tip jar.

I don't know Mike nor have I had any dialog with him, I sense he would be uncomfortable with asking or hinting for donations.

I just gave him some Dinari earlier for the value I've got out of the podcasts.

I've been listening to THoR from the get go, and it's a real podcast pleasure.

I'm always excited to hear the next one, (which I invariably listen to while procrastinating over essays!) and I couldn't agree more with Lisa's suggestion that Mike should turn his podcast scripts into a proper audio-book for audible.

Mike, if you read this, a huge thank you from a hitherto silent listener... You will have kept me company through (I think) my final year of undergrad and two MA's! Needless to say, I'm going to take Allan's advice and contribute to the 'tip jar'... Keep up the great work!

Is there a section of the site where all the audible recommendations are listed?  Can you please create one and post a link somewhere?

I dont have the patience to go back to all the episodes that mention audible.

Thanks

Mike,

What a great show! I started listening a month ago and can't believe I've digested 75 episodes of Roman History so quickly. Now that I'm caught up, I'm bitterly resigned to both the show and empire's impending end with less than 500 years to go! A mighty set of tomes, no doubt, but I'm with everyone else in the hope that you continue your writing and audio work. Not that I'm saying a mini-series based out of the city-states during the Renaissance would be amazing, but I know I'd get a kick out your take on the Ciompi Revolt!

Sorry for the mundane technical question, but iTunes only goes back to 31a Marius. Does anyone know how to get the rest of the episodes on iTunes? I know I can go to the website and just listen, but I'd like to have them to travel. Can they be re-posted or is there a way to load the urls (e.g., <a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/MikeDuncan-0103bBirthOfANationYouthfulIndiscretionsTheSevenKingsO147.mp3)">http://blip.tv/file/get/MikeDuncan-0103bBirthOfANationYouthfulIndiscretionsTheSevenKingsO147.mp3)</a> onto one's iTunes?  Again, apologies for technical question to this discussion, but take it as indicator of how much I enjoy the episodes.

How the heck do I download it?  And, if it's "download to desktop and then transfer to iTunes" -- well, how the heck do I download to desktop?

This Podcast was great. The only thing I would have to complain is that it ended very abruptly. Usually I enjoy hearing what you are going to do next week and really look forward for it, but for some strange reason, you go on like "... all men of senatorial rank had done their best..." and that's it. Tis' for this reason that I come to warn you, your podcast is incomplete. Hope that you soon correct this mistake before anybody else notices.

Other than that, Ireally love this episode.

Wish you the best of luck in all incoming endeavors.

"Is it any wonder then that the men who wrote the history of the Roman Empire, all men of senatorial rank, had done their best . . ." to what? To trash Domitian? To frequent only clean vomitoriums? To avoid ending their sentences with prepositions? What?

Great podcast, as usual. I can't wait to get to the 5 good emporers. But I would love to know what those men of senatorial rank all did their best to do.

I prefer to think this week's podcast was to end with words about something as trivial as men of senatorial status doing their best not to forget their umbrellas on rainy days.

Great podcast as always! You are a gifted storyteller and the quirky humor does not go unappreciated. This is one of the highlights of the beginning of my week.

Love the podcast,and seen several similar requests.  Where can I find the first thirty or so podcasts?  It seems iTunes bumps one every time a new one is posted, and I feel like I am really missing out.  I am deployed to Iraq with my reserve unit, and the podcast thing is really a bit of sanity w/o tv, radio, or newspapers.

Fantastic Podcast - I too am in the unfortunate position of having just completed the complete set and having to go back over it all again.

If I do have a minor gripe, it really jarred on my ear to hear Agricola rhyming with coca-cola ! (instead of agric-uh-la) I guess we all have our quirks of pronunciation ! - the other two that jump out at me is britania (a is short as in "rule britania" and not to rhyme with Mania - grates on the ear of a limey !) and I genuinely took a while to work out that e-quites are equites (eh-kwit-ays). But what the hell ! three words in 70 odd pod casts. I wish I could do anywhere near as well. Tom-ah-tos : Tom-ay-tos I guess ... Keep up the brilliant work !

I can't get over how fascinating this idea of a tax on urine collection is.  It's utterly mind boggling.  I'm a regular listener although I rarely comment but this piece of information has pushed me over the edge.

I don't even like taxes but I think I'd come around to the idea if we could think up progressively bizarre things to tax.  But of course there is surely no possible tax more bizarre than one on urine collection.

Keep up the good work.

Great episode of my joint favourite Emperor.  Well done!  And good timing, as Vespasian 2000th birthday is next week (we're having a party to celebrate).  But can I say that Domitian is not bad, he is very misunderstood and the victim of Trajanic propaganda.  Ok, he wasn't the best and he did loads wrong but he was not the monster he's made out to be.  I know loads of excellent books on the topic.

Mike,

I just discovered your series and have switched my iPod listening to your History exclusively. Thanks heaps for doing this; I will be forever in your debt. The more I listen episode by episode, the more I see eerie parallels to our own U.S. history and current international geopolitics. Your concise, well-researched series has been engaging and instructive, and I only wish every high-placed politician and/or bureaucrat in the U.S. was required to listen to this series.

I spent 11 years as an officer in the Navy, and I was always amazed and disheartened by a general disinterest in history among my fellow junior (and some senior) officers. Your series would fill a very large gap in officer education and would provide much-needed perspective on military service and policy making. Staff colleges are designed mostly to fill this gap, but your series would make a hugely-important bit of history (the 1,000 years of the Roman kingdom/republic/empire) acessbile to those who weren't destined for staff colleges in the near future (i.e. those junior officers). Your podcast format makes the series easily accessible and would offer the versatility/portability needed by many military members with tight schedules and not a lot of time to sit still on one place, undisturbed, for several hours.

Thanks for helping a young ex-warrior like me place myself in a larger spectrum. Keep up the excellent work, Mike. Though I'm only just through the Gracchi brothers in the late Republic, I am looking forward to the rest of the series with much anticipation. This also gives me a great side motivator for going to the gym for several hours. I figure since I'm unemployed I might as well get in better shape and learn something. So I'm killing two birds with one stone these days, thanks to you.

Respecfully,
John McGee,
ex-Lieutenant Commander, USN

P.S. I was stationed up at NAS Whidbey Island for the majority of my Naval service. I love it up that way. I wish I was still in the Seattle area as well.

Can someone point me in the right direction to be able to have episode 1 to 24 on iTunes ?  It starts at 25 and it really aggravates me...  I don't want to have to listen on my computer!

Re: first 24 episodes

I downloaded them manually from the old site:
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.blogspot.com/">http://thehistoryofrome.blogspot.com/</a>

Then I imported them into iTunes using "Add to Library". They show up under Music, but it works.

Did Vespasian's disaster relief efforts extend to the eruption of Vesuvius or was that during Titus's reign? Was there any response from the empire?

I've been looking at that.  Vesuvius, I think, erupted a month after Vespasian died.
Google time...
Vespasian died 23rd June, 79AD.
Vesuvius erupts 24th of August.

That must have surely caused a major round of portents and prophesies.

Interesting to hear about how Emperors would be reputed to perform miracles and fulfill prophesies.  Ancient world PR campaigns.

Thanks for another great podcast. I really enjoyed it over the pond here in London.  Will donate via paypal this week and I hope it will help with your expenses.  A small suggestion? Have you thought about opening an Amazon.com Affiliates Account? If we go to amazon via your page i believe you would get 5-10% of purchases without it costing us, your dedicated listeners, one little pence.

Once again Thank You! These podcasts really help brighten my commute to and from the University of London :)

Hello Mike,
 I am currently in Italy studying IR for a year and was wondering if you can provide a list of not to be missed historical Roman sights while touring through Italy. I'm currently studying in Bologna. I am a huge History of Rome fan and have been for a long time (April 08). I draw tons of inspiration from your podcast and find the period covering the rise and fall of Julius Ceaser the most fascinating. Currently catching up on school so i'm a bit backed up with regards to your podcast(life always gets in the way). Keep doing what you are doing.

Thank you for your podcast,

A loyal fan

I'm amazed after stories like this how Rome managed to hold itself together for another 400 years.  The Empire's provinces seem so disconnected, doing their own thing with only nominal loyalty to Rome.

To piggy back on what Gregorian said...

Could you maybe mention what the mood/reaction in the provinces was during all this emperor upheaval. You often mention what the reaction of the people of rome was to actions of their rulers, but did it really affect someone in Gaul, Spain or Egypt? Or were they just informed that someone new was going to be on the coins and carried on with life as usual.

Was there any talk of fighting for independence now that there was weakness/uncertainty at the top of the leadership pyramid?

Poor Otho.
Perhaps if I was in his situation, I'd prefer to put on some peasants clothes and just sneak off to be a simple farmer for the rest of my life.

It's not like very many people know what you look like.  There's no TV, newspapers or photography.

Mike, fine podcast as always.  Just FYI "Rubicon", which you recommended as an Audible download, is unfortunately not available.  It is listed on Amazon, but no Audible at least as far as I could tell.  I would love to listen to this title - could you link to it?   After reading (listening?)to "Augustus" I an ready for another Rome-filled book...

Keep up the good work!

I have one point to make, it's not about the content but the fact then when I downloaded my iPod from iTunes the podcasts were not in number order, is it something that iTunes can correct. Very best wishes from The County of Worcestershire, UK

I'm not listening week to week, rather downloading the podcast and listening to them later, so I only recently heard episode 53, asking about commercial endorsement.  I, too, am a Roman history amateur enthusiast.  I think what you have done is remarkable.  I've heard some fact errors, and I disagree with some of your prespectives.  Still, it's a great primer and refresher course.  What an effort it must take.  If you get a little recompense, I, for one, wouldn't take it amiss.  In the end, it's whether you feel compromised which counts.  Keep up the good work.

Great podcast, extremely well done with lots of information about the historically unrivaled political and military intrigue.  I am curious if there is any historical information about communication issues involved in ruling such a large society and territory given the unavailability of printed word at the time.

How exactly was Rome able to communicate precisely with societies who spoke a different, often unknown language?  Even today, I find communication issues to be the single most likely problem experienced by individuals and organizations.  I know Latin was the dominant language, but surely Rome encountered tribes and nations which spoke a language completely dissimilar to Latin.

Rome was obviously the military superpower of the time, so perhaps they didn't need to know that the words they used with foreign cultures were precise.  Perhaps the mere presence of their armies was sufficient to articulate the message that other societies must submit to Rome or be destroyed.

Still, running an empire on a day-by-day basis must have required an extraordinary ability to communicate with subjects in an accurate manner so that all sides understood what was going on.

If anyone has information about this subject, I would be most grateful for elucidation.

Mike:  love the podcasts, find them really informative, and appreciate the fact that you make corrections from time to time.

Congratulations and welcome to married life.  I was recently in Rome and took in the Pantheon.  You were right on this one, it is impressive. See some of my pics at:

Congratulations on your marriage. I'd just to like to ask you to continue the series through the Byzantine Empire because it's one of the few things that my dad and I can listen to in the car together while we go to and from work and it gives us something to bond over. He doesn't warm up to many podcasts like this but The History of Rome by you has his full attention.

Firstly, very nice episode.

Second. There seems to be another echo and (slight) helium part at 10:45. The echo seems to last longer than during episode 64 and I only noticed the helium whilst listening to that specific part. It also isn't as high pitched.

Could someone please confirm?

Just a couple questions, I just finished episode 52 and Mike says if there are any questions just "drop me an email", but he does not give his email address out. How do we contact him?? The next question is regarding what history to believe. I have read the first three Colleen McCullough Masters of Rome series and have noticed some differences to what she writes compared to what is in the podcasts, minor differences, but differences none the less.
Wanted to end by saying that I love the podcasts and what a great job Mike does.

I can only hear the echo whilst listening on my mp3 player. On my pc (with 5.1 surround) I can't hear it. So could anyone please try listening with there mp3 player/iPod.

@ Don Wieber,

I think it's best to leave Mike for now. Let him focus on the things that really matter. But that's just my opinion.

@Don
Good question on what history to believe.  Ancient History is nowhere near as cut and dry as Mike makes it sound. There are many conflicting opinions, even on some relatively settled matters.  That said, any good historian will conduct a thorough historiography before plunging in.  From the literary references that Mike has dropped so far it sounds like he is using a pretty good combination of primary and secondary sources.  He leans heavily on primary sources but is careful to keep these in context (i.e. pointing out that Tacitus is a bit of a gossip).  He also leans on good secondary sources that have done their homework when he goes into speculative history (such as Anthony Everitt).  As far as what history to believe, I say read (and listen) to a whole bunch of sources and come to an informed and intelligent conclusion of your own.  Thus makes a historian.

There's a handful of podcasts that have really entertained me, and I figure they deserve at least a small economic Thank You.  So, thank you.

Congratulations on the wedding and welcome to Austin. The heat has been brutal this summer so you are arriving about the right time. Its a great city.

Anyway, very nice podcast. I'd be interested to see a few more centered on specific subjects like this, though I have to say the narratives that tell a story are the podcasts that are the most engaging.

Thanks and good luck with the move!

Hi Mike

I hope your wedding goes off wihtout a hitch. Good luck to you and the future Mrs History of Rome. I am looking forward to your return.

Good news I have found a book about Scipio Africanus to pass the time between updates, bad news it is written entirely in Spanish. I must have been crazy when I brought the book, because my understanding of the Spanish language is still very limited. But you know we dont have many well written Historical Fantasy books about Ancient Rome in Germany, most authors prefer to write about the Middle Ages, so I thought what the heck and it is only until you get back to your podcast.

I wish you a happy marriage and may Jupiter smile up on you and your future wife.

Ps: I would love to make a contribution to the moving fund, but unfortionately I myself am going to move very soon so I am rather stipped shot of cash at the moment. I hope you do not send the wrath of the gods after me, aka flood my distict. :-)

Alexa

hey Mike,

Congradulations on your upcoming marriage. I started listening to your podcasts regularly since before the Samnite Wars. You are a gifted historical raconteur. I appreciate all of your work. Thanks.

To the soon to be Mr and Mrs Historyofrome

Just want to add my best wishes and congratulations. Have made a denotation to the moving fund and as I highly value your show I really just wish I could donate more at the present time.

While I struggled early on with the myths of Rome you guys really had me from the point you explained the story of Publius Claudius Pulcher and the sacred chickens:

“how he expected to win without the approval of the sacred chickens is a mystery”

This mixture of history and wit not to mention an incredible work ethic has meant you guys have produced such a high quality program and why so many of us will be missing our weekly historical fix while the show is off the air.

On a personal note on Monday I fly back to Australia after completing a two and a half month holiday of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. I do not know if I would have chosen such a trip if over a year ago I did not stumble across this program which started a mountain of reading on the Roman and Byzantine empires.

Thank you both. I hope to hear Mikes voice again in late October.

Sincerely,

Neil Chard Dorney

Mike,

Congrats on your wedding and loved the podcast.  Perhaps you can revisit the topic and discuss the origins of the customs and how they evolved from the times of the kings, through the Republic and then the empire.

Hi Mike,

I enjoyed this newest episode, the second 'Special' in your Series.
I wish you the best on your coming Nuptuals and Welcome to Texas! :)
There has been some conjecture about how far you should go in this series, and I get the feeling that your not so keen on the Byzantine Empire, so?

I'd like to point out to your listeners another iTunes Podcast called: 12 Byzantine Rulers: The History of The Byzantine Empire by Lars Brownworth. This 18 part series covers the Empire from Diocletian c. 22 December 244 – 3 December 311 until the last Emporer, Constantine XI February 8, 1405 – May 29, 1453.

Thanks again for a great listen!

Dear Mike

My wife, Alison (she of Macro descent) and I were married one year ago, packed up eveything and moved to Rome.  So, it can be done, but boy will you be busy!  I expect you'll be gone for a while, but not too long, I hope.

I listen to your podcast most days while driving through the city to and from work and it brings a real feeling of intimacy with the history of this wonderful city.  I'll miss your easy style, but thankfully you've established quite a back catalogue which certainly can be enjoyed on the second or even third listening - there's always something new to hear.

Best of luck to both of you, and with the move

John

PS your dead pan comparison of the tactics used to down Hannibal's war elephants and the Imperial walkers still makes me smile.

But mate I gotta thank you for getting me through the endless hours and transporting me away on an adventure into a past to which i previously had no real interest. You have ignited in me a real passion for all things roman. Im not an avid reader but im seriously thinking of getting my own set of Gibbon.

Mike (or any who would care to comment)

Firstly, warmest congratulations on the nuptuals. I wish both you and the new Mrs History-Of-Rome all the happiness in the world.
I hope the move to Austin went well.

I didn't start following your podcast until fairly recently, but have now become quite a fan, singing your praises from this side of the pond.
I managed to track down the earlier episodes, and am now pretty much caught up.

I do have a couple of questions for you though.
This is, in part, in connection with a couple of dramatisations dealing with the later life, and inevitable death, of Caesar. They are both BBC productions, and I'm not sure if you will have come across them. The mini-series 'Rome', which spent much time dealing with the eating of doormice and seems to be remembered more for copious amounts of full frontal 'in-your-face' nudity, than for the actual history, (one immortal scene, though, which makes me laugh, has Mark-Anthony entering Caesars' tent, meeting Caesars' ultimate assassin, and uttering the line "Brutus, me old cock!") and the 6-part series 'Ancient Rome - The Rise And Fall Of An Empire' by Simon Baker. In the case of the latter, I'm not sure which came first, the book or the series. I only really refer to 'Rome' as it seems to agree with your podcasts in most significant respects.
Some of the content of 'Rise And Fall', though, in the episode dealing with Caesar, seems to differ significantly from your own account.
This version has Caesar off to fight in Spain between crossing the Rubicon and marching into Rome. It is my understanding that this was pretty much the last action of the war. It also makes reference to the mutiny of the Legions, but states that the 9th Legion mutinied before this trip to Spain, which it places at the start of the civil war, instead of just prior to the invasion of Africa, as your podcast suggests, nearing the end of the conflict.
Your podcast makes it clear that Caesar cleverly dealt with this rebellion without spilling blood, instead shaming the men into ending the mutiny, but 'Rise And Fall' has Caesar decimating the 9th Legion as a reprisal. I guess it is this event that has prompted me to write, as it so goes against the apparent merciful nature of the man as I understand it to be from your own work. He may have been a bit selfish, but I quite liked the guy! Are the crew at 'Rise And Fall' doing him an injustice?
Is this simply a case of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story, or are there other accounts which may better justify their version of history?
I have taken your podcasts to be a well researched and accurate re-telling of history, but it seems unlike the BBC to mis-inform to such a degree.

Once again, I am thoroughly enjoying your series, and look forward to your picking up where you left off. (as long as the Wife lets you, of course!)
I hope you are considerring turning this work into a book. I will be one of the first to buy it if you do.

Best Regards, and good luck, once again.

Steve O'Grady (UK)

Hey, I'm a student studying abroad in Rome. I never before had much interest in ancient history. I mostly stuck to mythology, but living in Rome these last few months makes the history come alive. I wanted to thank you for guiding me through the history, you've made the scholastic part of my trip. I'm a big fan.

Anyway I am a fairly serious photographer and I happen to be here for another three weeks. Is there anything you wanted a royalty free photo of while I'm here?

Drop me an email. I think you see the invisible email we put in but if not just post something on the comments and I will respond.

Roman weddings were the source for many of our own marriage traditions. A ring on the third finger of a girl's left hand symbolized engagement. At the wedding ceremony the bride was dressed in white, wore a veil and was accompanied by a bridesmaid.

I hope that the Roman Emperors are not role models for you in your choosing of a wife. So far we have had Livia, Messalina, Agrippina and Poppaea... Maybe your future wants your Podcast and intends to cast you aside as soon as its within her grasp!

Just kidding

Hey, i've been a long time listener, since the episodes on the Roman legions, and i've been staying with you ever since.  This is the single best podcast i've ever seen, and i tend to hold it as the benchmark for any future podcast that happens to come about.  The only one that has compared i feel is the "twelve Byzantine Rulers" ironically enough also about Rome.

I just have a few comments.  Please don't take it as some sort of criticism, just some things that i've noticed over time

1) Over the course of the series, there seems to be a pattern with nymphanic women who eventually bring scandal upon there men.   Augistian's daughter and granddaughter, Claudius' wife, Nero's mother.  Why does this keep repeating?  The only really powerful political women who isn't sleeping around is Livia  and she is either poisoning people if you belive Graves, or is ruthlessly putting Tiberius in power.  In the same vein, the old Romans seems were very big on being furgal and conservative, but we have seen this increase in all types of decidence.  Is that just the new generation of luxury or is there something else involved
2) The parithian empire has played a key point in these various episodes about rome, but who exactly are they?  When talking about Carthage, Spain, Greece, Gaul and the pre Roman Italians, you went into some detail about both there culture and there relation to rome, but who exactly are the parthians.  I know they are located in Persians, but wasn't there some other Empire there, the Seluceens or something like that, from Alexander, and the Romans beat them heartily.  Why do the Romans fear these guys, and how do they get along.  With is Arminia so important to them both, why don't the Romans just annex it.  How do these people relate, especially since these two sides have interacted for such a long time, and don't seem to be going away any time soon.
3) This is a more minor thing, but you sometimes seem to skim over the personalities of important people.  Whenever you explain a character, you always get a good grasp of there personality, Julius Caesar, crassius, pompey, Brutus, ect ect.  but some people are kind of skimmed over.  Cato the younger seems to play a big role in the story, but at no point do you really explain the guy's personality, other than conservative and tough.  I looked him up later and managed to get your references, but at the time i was rather confused.  And some people kinda vanish, like the praetorian prefect under Nero.

But anyways, i love your podcast, and i think you are a wonderful story teller and historian, since i've finally managed to get a good understanding of Roman history.  I would like to say, through i think you've heard it before, to keep this going even after the fall of Rome, until the end of the Byzantine age, because there isn't much infomation on it, and the other podcast on it is already over, and only gives a brief over view rather than an indepth look.  also its a good follow up to the history of rome, as Byzantine is in a way Rome continued and it would be great if you could explain it in that very cool detailed manner you can pull off.  but in the end its your choice

My regards
EE

Hey long time listener (listened to all of them twice now, and made my wife listen the second time through).  It is a great podcast and do not understand why there are not more like it...

I was wondering if anyone could comment in this thread or next week's thread about good historic locations to visit off the beaten path in Italy? Of course I will swing by all the main places to see in Rome, and I hope to hit up a few battle sites, etc.  I was wondering if anyone knew of anything really special or interesting that might be a little less well known? I am going there in about 3 weeks and would love to get some insider info.

Thanks a lot for helping spread erudition!

I just want to say that I have listened to these many times through, and the first thing I did when I got internet connection in Iraq was to download all of the newest episodes. Your Podcast has entertained me thoroughly and given me a strong enough base that I can pick the specific periods that I want to expand on. I loved the episodes surrounding Octavian's rise to Caesar Augustus, what a remarkable and long sighted man he was!

Hello Mike,

First of all, good luck with the move and the wedding. I hope it's a lovely day.

Next, as it's my first time to comment here let me also say how much I enjoy the podcasts. You have really made learning about this period in history a pleasure.

Lastly, would it be possible to re-upload (is that even a word?) the original episodes on to i-Tunes? I know I can get them from the typepad link but if it's on i-Tunes I can put all the series together on my i-Pod. Also it'll give me something to listen to while you are honeymooning and packing boxes etc!

Keep up the good work!

To MG,

The reason that the episodes are not showing up on iTunes is an RSS feed limit of 50 posts. Some time ago Mike started to bundle the earlier episodes together but for some reason he stopped doing that.

So, in brief, I don't think it's possible to get the earlier episodes on iTunes, sorry.

Detlef

ps. Welcome to the comment section! Also to the other first-timers we've had over the last few episodes, welcome!

In the last episode you said that Otho was born in 32 BCE making him the youngest of them all. If I'm not mistaken shouldn't that be 32 CE, no worries though it's not like that took away for the greatness of the show.


P.S I hope you have a great wedding and a wonderful break.

Hi Mike,

A bit of an open-ended question for you:

As you of course already know, today (more or less) marks the woefully-neglected 2000 year anniversary of the disaster in the Teutoberg Forest.  How, would you venture to guess, would the history of Rome have played out differently if Herrmann's plot had been foiled and Germania brought under the Roman yoke?

I ask specifically in reference the relations between Rome and the East.  With the northern frontier still open, might Rome have delayed or even avoided entanglement with the petty kings of Asia?  Or would her victory over the Germans have only made her stronger, and better able to take and hold the East later on?

Not looking for much here - just an impression of someone closer to the material than I.

Thanks for a great series!

-b

Just a quick note to mention that I recently discovered Podcasts and this one in particular.  Have been listening to maybe two or three episodes a day.  Thank you very much for all your hard work! On a side note, as someone who has gotten married very recently, Good luck.  I remember the days of (Last month) "Honey, which flower arrangement do you like?" and "What songs should we play?".  But it is all worth it.

Great podcast as always.  I just have one quick question that i was hoping someone would help me with.  Mike mentioned that Vespasian was from the equestrian class and i recalled that the biggest or one of the biggest problems Sejanus faced in his power play was that he was from the equestrian class... so why was Vespasian's non senatorial birth not an issue?  Its entirely possible that Mike was planning on covering this issue in the next podcast or two, if so... I apologize for my impatience

As a loyal listener from many episodes past, something had been bothering me for the past few episodes, and I thought I might as well let you know.

I find that in the early episodes you spoke more slowly, and in the more recent (the past ten or so) ones you have a more energetic, and faster way of speaking.

Now, ofcourse, some folks might prefer the latter style, but I found that the slower style gave me a little mental room to think and imagine what you were saying without losing track.

None the less, love the show, and please keep up the good work. Just wanted to let you know in case you hadn't noticed.

I love this podcast.  I am addicted and will have some serious withdrawl when Mike takes the leap. Anyway, one thing that has bothered me is that many of these emperors are assasinated and there never seems to be any (or at least any mention of) trial or punishment of the assasins even though history tells us who they are.  What's up with that?

I hope you do go all the way to 1453 ... the real fall of the Roman Empire, but if you decide to stop with the fall of the west, you could tell your listeners about Lars Brownworth's excellent series on the Byzantine Empire (available as podcasts on iTunes).

Now here is where my question really lies, how bad is exile?  What did exile really mean?  Were conditions really that horrid or was it more of an honor blow that made them choose suicide? Thanks again!

Isn't it possible that the calls to continue into the later Byzantine era are listeners expressing that they don't wan't the podcast to end. In which case they are completly delusional (no offence meant). Face it! One of these days Mike will upload the last episode of THoR. After that, it will itself be a part of history.

Great podcast as always... I like that these last ones have been a little longer. 20, 25, 30 minutes is great.

Incidentally, it sounds like Nero not only hesitated in stabbing himself, but didn't do it right. If you are still alive and talking after you've put a knife through your throat, you ain't doing it right.

Should have had a slave do it.

Mike,

I am a long time and avid listener to these podcasts - they are brilliant and one of the clearest and most concise accounts of Roman history, which at times can be ridicuously confusing.  But as an avid Flavian fan I must point out that Vespasian was born in 9AD (17th November), not 17AD and Titus was born in 39AD (on 30th December).

I await with anticipation on the upcoming episodes about the Flavians.  Have you read The Emperor Domitian by Brian W Jones?  It is by far the best source for anything Domitian related.

Keep up the amazing work!

Dear Mike, again I want to express my thanks for your awesome podcast, which I enjoy immensely and listen to over and over.
Like Vikas I too think your speaking tempo has gone up a bit, and strangely enough, since the audible adverts the soundquality seems to be less, sometimes distorted at the start. But that is a minor detail.
Congratulations on your marriage, may the Roman Gods and any God for that matter be with you and your family.

Hilariously long time listner; first time poster! Loved the story of Nero! One of my favorites so far!

Maybe a great place to stop would be at the end of Justinian's reign 565AD!

It seems a shame to think that characters such as the great general Belisarius, Narses, Theodora and Justinian's Sassanid counterpart Khusrau would be missed out!

The great events like Justinian's reconquests in the West, the bubonic plague, the final war with the Vandals, the complete revision of roman law and the great and costly Gothic Wars in Italy would be missed out if we stopped in 476AD!

And Justinian was a Latin speaker after all!

Don Franzen,

"I hope you do go all the way to 1453 ..."

I would much prefer he covered American history as he had expressed an interest in doing so.  Of course, the problem with that idea is that in order to really contribute something new to our understanding of American history he probably wouldn't be able to avoid being controversial.

American history, and to a greater extent enlightenment and post-enlightenment European history, is full of clashing exotic philosophies which make the history as much about ideas as about dates and battles and such.

In contrast, so far the character and philosophy of the Romans seems quite simple:  because they did and/or because I can and want to.  Christianity will come along soon, and just make the whole thing more confusing and ugly.  The latter being because Christianity was used as an excuse for brutality and didn't restrain pre-existing brutality and thereby makes everyone look more hypocritical.

Anyways, American history is not the same kind of beast.  It would be interesting to see how mike covered it.

I too agree with the person who commented on the pace of delivery. I thought my Ipod was set up wrong or someone else had taken over. Not to worry.
I have listened from the start, whilst cycling to and from work, and when I am all wrapped up, with the headphones under my wooly hat, you are great company and put my mind far away from the bitter cold and wind.
When I get home, I always wait til the end of that particular episode, before I even take off my coat.
Great stuff, keep it up!

You're providing great and detailed information, and i really appreciate it. You are also helping me know what topics to search for as i try and find sources to cite for this paper. I just wanted to say hey, and thanks! I was also wondering what sources you use for your own research, if that is something that you can share, of course.

Mike, Congratulations on your wedding.

An interesting thing about the Number of the Beast: when 666 is written in roman numerals (as St. John did) it's DCLXVI -- the first six roman numerals written backwards.  The modern equivalent would be 654,321.

I really enjoy the podcast.

Hi Mike...Thanks for the honest, objective account of my Christian forebearers.  I'm very willing to admit that church father's "scape-goated" Nero as the evil tyrant he (mostly) was.

However, the book of Revelation is singular, not plural.  Common mistake.  No worries.  God forgives.  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

Also, would your audience understand the cannibalism reference?

Congrats on getting married.  Marriage is sacred.  (Sorry, couldn't resist again.)

Hey there Mike,congrats on the upcoming wedding. While it is popular in the secular world to associate nero with the 666 designation,it just is not biblically accurate.Certain things need to happen BEFORE the appearance of the antichrist which the Apostle John wrote about in the book of revelation. Namely the rapture of the church and the war of Gog and Magog. These things will usher in the great tribulation and then the anti christ will make his appearance.While I have loved the history of rome podcast,you may want to research more thoroughly the biblical resources when speaking of Christianity and not just the secular sources.

long time listener first time caller. Congratulations on the upcoming nuptials, a rome loving woman is hard to find.

How about for the big finale going from Heraclius to Basil the Bulgar Slayer and then straight to 1453. 26 minutes should just about cover it :^)

Hi Mike, congratulations on the forthcoming wedding and good luck on the move. You CANNOT stop doing these podcasts, at least do the Flavians before you call it a day. As for all the Christian comments, do these people realise Christianity is a cult. It'll never catch on hehe.

Congratulations to your marriage. Honestly, it is like you are an older brother which I have known my whole life. You have validated my wish to study history.
Once again Congratulations to your marriage. I just hope you find the time to continue your wonderful podcast.

Note to Ian...I'm trying VERY hard not to let my Christian brothers and sisters know that they're in a cult, and I do not appreciate you letting the cat out of the bag.  Please, shhhh.

Note to Barry...I think Mike was speaking tongue-in-cheek about whether or not Nero was the anti-christ.  In point of fact, I'd note that the New Testament comments on many antichrists in present, past and future (1 Jn. 2:18,22).

Note to Mike...Sorry to get you caught up in internecine Christian squabbles.  BTW, Austin's a great city.  Lived their for two years.  Go see the bats!

greetings,

Love the podcast and give my best to your lovely new wife.

I wanted to offer my services to your podcast.

I am fortunate enough to be currently living in Germany..right on the Rhine.
Xanten-Haltern-Neuss-Cologne-Trier-Mainz-Nijmegan-Utrecht and many other Roman towns are just a stone's throw away.

So if you ever felt like adding some photographs to your podcast, let me know. I would be happy to jump on a train and snap some photos of walls, battlefields or anything else.

MM:)

September 23rd</a>.* What I have not alluded to is that, after a brief honeymoon,
we are throwing The History of Rome’s Research Assistant in the backseat and
moving to Austin, TX.&#0160;What’s that you say? You couldn’t be happier for
us?&#0160;Well, don’t get too excited, because this does have ramifications for
the show schedule.



</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>*<em>By an eerie
coincidence this happens to be Augustus’s birthday. The sacred chickens appear
to be gorging themselves.</em> </p>



<p><o:p></o:p>The long and short of it is that The History of Rome is
going to be off the air for about a month. The last show before the wedding will
post Sept 13 and the first show back after the break will be Oct 18. Between
the wedding, the honeymoon and the move, I just don’t think I’ll have the time
to focus enough on the show to make it any good so I’m not even going to try
(and I think the Really-Soon-To-Be-Mrs. History of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place></st1:city>Rome would have justifiable grounds for an
annulment if she caught me working on the podcast during our honeymoon).

</p>

<p><o:p></o:p>When it comes to the long term future of the show I want to
address the growing number of calls in the comments for me to press on past 476<span> </span>and cover the <st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place>Byzantine
 Empire in full. I don’t want to shut the door on the idea
completely (because who knows how I’ll feel when it actually comes time to fish
or cut bait), but to be clear: this is probably not going to happen. Not only
is the Byzantine Empire outside my comfort zone academically, but I plan on
heading back to school after establishing residency in Texas and am skeptical
of my ability to keep up the pace of a weekly podcast and knock out a Master’s
Degree at the same time. So, like it says it right there in the header: <em>A weekly podcast tracing the history of the
Roman Empire, beginning with Aeneas&#39;s arrival in Italy and ending (someday)
with the exile of Romulus Augustulus, last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire.</em></p><p><em></em>



</p><p><o:p></o:p>In the long long term, I have enjoyed this all so much that I
would definitely want to return to podcasting when life/school/career permit,
but now we’re talking 2 ½ - 3 years out and in technological terms that’s an
eternity. By that point, to be blunt, podcasting might be obsolete. So while I
have been fiddling off an on with an American History project (that has grown
from a simple, biography driven show on the Presidents to an overarching economic-political
history of the <st1:country-region w:st="on"></st1:country-region>United States*)
and often get lost in Wikipedia pages on Ancient Mesopotamia (Ur! Woooo!), whether or not podcasting <em>per se</em> turns out to be the platform for
those projects remains to be seen.

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&#0160;</o:p>*<em>Dear International
Listeners: this will be cool, I promise. <o:p></o:p></em></p>



<p><em><o:p></o:p></em>So to sum up: Episodes for the next four weeks? Yes!
Episodes for the four weeks after that? No. Episodes for another year (or more)
until we get to the fall of the <st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place>Western Roman Empire?
Yes! Episodes after that covering the Byzantine Empire?
Probably not. Some future Mike Duncan history project covering a yet-to-be-determined topic on a yet-to-be-invented
New Media platform? Boy I hope so; I&#39;m having a ball.</p><p>Mike</p><p><em>[Update]: For those of you who are curious, our wedding page is located <a href="http://registry.weddingchannel.com/wedding_websites/PersonalWebsite.action?occ=575684011&amp;view=wp&amp;c=575684011&amp;s=10&amp;t=100&amp;p=24&amp;l=48842">here</a>.

There is already a very good podcast covering Byzantium. <a href="http://www.12byzantinerulers.com/">http://www.12byzantinerulers.com/</a>

 If you do get on to something else I think a different topic would be a good choice.  The American History idea sounds intriguing.

Instead of going forward, maybe you should go back to Greece and it's history before rome. By the way congrats to you and the soon-to-be-history-of-rome

First of all, congratulations on your wedding and the honeymoon. Though you can probably expect something on the day itself. Or atleast sent on the day itself. Somehow I doubt you will be checking your e-mail on the day of your wedding.

Second, if I remember correctly, last time you moved house you vanished for months, just make sure you really are back on october 18th.

Third. To recommomend a replacement podcast during Mike's absence. Something I've told before, Lars Brownworth (12 Byzantine Rulers) is starting a new podcast about the Normans and the first episode should be up somewhere in September. Could be a nice substite...

And to save the best for last. Thank you! You've been a part of my life for the past 16 months. Or at least your voice has. Though I've never met you, like Mark Mullen said, you almost seem like a friend. Just to say to seem to be an extremely likable person. Again, thank you for everything!

Best Wishes,

As a loyal fan of this podcast, I wish to express gratitude to you for starting and faithfully continuing a project of this size for as long as you have.

I am a fellow lover of history (merely as an amateur, however, unfortunately) and of the subjects that are near and dear to my heart, Roman civilization forms the very center of my interests. Your podcast is one of a handful of bright spots I look forward to every week.

While I find it unfortunate that you do not wish to exceed the fall of the Western Empire in your scope (as Byzantine history is by far the pinnacle of my interest in the mountain that is Roman civilization), I can fully understand your hesitation.

As a fan and as a fellow human being, I wish you all the best in life, as the enviable seas of matrimony are tumultuous indeed.

Mike,
Unlike the Main Stream Media, geeks have long memories. If you come back in three years there will be a majority of us ready to hop back on with whatever your new project is. (It would coincidentally be awesome for me as a Jefferson fanboy if you choose American History) Maybe you could hit up NPR on the comeback to remind us nerds "hey, remember that guy you liked? he's doin stuff again".
Congrads on the wedding, and have fun.

As other poster said I will listen what ever you decide to cover since you are a marvellous story teller and turn a live the ancient Romans by the way you tell the history.

Congratulations on your wedding and impending honeymoon. And, of course, your future studies.

I have greatly enjoyed the History of Rome since its inception, and been astonished that you've kept it up at such high quality all along. If anything, the history of the Roman Empire itself demonstrates that nothing lasts forever, and, like other historical epics (say, Titanic), we all now more or less how it ends.

That said, I can see where you might return at a later date to some of the chapters you've glided over to color in some detail. I'm always keen on 'day in the life of' history, and your descriptions of the political processes at various points in Roman history has been as engaging as coverage of modern politics.

So, the History of Rome: it may one day end, but it can continue to grow.

Go Team Mike!  Congratulation on your marriage and, just to echo a few voices here, I've enjoyed your podcast immensely.  Thanks for all you've done and thanks for continuing the program given the ups and downs that life throws at you.

I have a few book suggestions for Kyle... I'm currently reading Caesar: Life of a Colossus by Adrian Goldsworthy.  The book reads more like a story than your standard academic texts, which I like.  There's also Peter Heather's The Fall of Roman Empire, and of course Edward Gibbon's volumes.  One book that I found OUTSTANDING to flip through was As The Romans Did (edited by Jo-ann Shelton).  It contains a bunch of primary source material explaining nearly everything about Roman culture.  A little pricey, but it's pretty nice to return to every now and then.

Hope this helps!

Well, Mike, whatever history show you put out I will listen too. I'm not an American, a Canadian actually, but I would be more than happy to listen to your version of "The History of The U.S.". I think anyone who has any respect for democracy and/or freedom has to at least have some interest in the founding fathers.


Anyways, I'm here until the end. Best of luck!

Dear Mike,

                    I would like to let you know just how great this podcast has been. I really do feel like I'm losing a friend here. I live in the downtown Austin area, and I have a truck, so if there is anything I can do to help with moving in, please don't hesitate to e-mail me at Imahoss1030@yahoo.com

Congratulations

Congratulations, Mike!  Although to be honest, on the merits of marriage I'm with William Godwin:  anarchy is the surest way forward for men and women alike. Notwithstanding a wedding being a fantastic excuse for a boogie. Enjoy.

Mike,

I like the special episodes.  The marriage episode is a good idea and the Christmas episode was a good one as well.  I think you could crank out at least 3 months of episodes covering things like religion, food, bondage, architecture, women's rights and the like without disrupting the flow of the shows through time.

And shall probably go back to episode 1 and relisten right from the start!  Texas is a long way from cool, rainy, mountainous Scotland, but like so many of your international fan club have said, it feels like you're an old friend.

Congratulations on your forthcoming nuptials.

I am glad that you will be continuing until the demise of the Western Empire and am envious that you can return to School, that sounds like much more fun than the day job (well mine anyway).

Thanks ever so much for the podcasts so far, they are just so informative and have debunked the Robert Graves and HBO views of the world.

Incidentally I visited Fishbourne Palace near Portsmouth in England, not far from where I live. It is to be recommended as a site worthy of visiting to see some of how Romans colonised this far island on the edge of the world.

Best Wishes and thanks again..

Hearty congratulations to both of you from a very wet and windy Cornwall! I suppose we can get along without you for a few weeks (only a few mind!) - but please Mrs Mike, bring him back safe and sound for us!

Mike - would like to thank you for the many hours of fascinating and enjoyable Roman delight. I've walked for miles across moorland with you at my side (hope that doesn't sound too freaky!). I grew up in the County of Essex (not 'Essex County' - sorry to be pedantic) and visited Colchester(Camulodunum)Castle many times on school trips. Seeing (and still being able to touch back in the 1970s) the remains of the Temple of Claudius marked the beginning of a lifelong fascination with the Republic and Empire which your excellent work has re-invigorated. Thanks again and enjoy!

Well done on the up coming nuptials, enjoy the day and I hope it will be for you, as it was for myself, the best day of your life.  As for the direction of the show, it is your baby, so do with it as you will.  As one of the “international” listeners I will take your word for your American Political History thing being cool, I have always enjoyed US history and could not imagine not enjoying it if you get that far.

Once again well done and congratulations to you and the soon to be bride.

 I love this podcast and have learned much more from this than podcasts of college lectures.

I will definitely listen to other podcasts, but I would love to hear your take on the Byzantines. 12 Byzantine Emperors was fantastic, but it only looks at 12 Emperors and I'm sure you'd go much more in-depth.

Thank you for your excellent work and I wish you the best in Texas!

I would like to extend my congratulations too. I was going to also recommmend the 12 Byzantine Rulers, it's not quite as good as History of Rome but if Mike is going to stop at the fall of Rome it does mean there's a continuum.
From a Brit, I'd be more than happy to have a US history podcast from Mike. So far, I've found that US podcasters do history better than us Brits. Mike and Dan Carlin are both excellent, the Brit ones tend to be people obviously reading from scripts and I'd rather read myself.

On Podcasts: I think you should resist the pressure to do byzantium since its clearly something you are not entirely comfortable with.

However, I as well would love to see more work from you. Obviously what you do is up to you, but as the great and already linked 12 byzantine rulers shows, you don't need to keep up a weekly schedule. A monthly podcast can work fine, especially when its such good quality.

I’ll anxiously await your return, but wish you all the best. Have a great honeymoon and move.  I have to admit that I kinda like the image I have of you researching in the mind-addling heat of your second story apartment. I’m hopeful that this is will remain a feature of THoR – after all, Texas is pretty hot.  Chopin coughing blood onto the piano keys, Keats wheezing through some Ode or another, Mike sweating over his microphone – it’s a beautiful thing. Such dedication.

	To Kyle (the high school student): Mike’s broadcast will be a great introduction to the whole shebang for you, and give you a solid context for further reading.  For the time being, as a literature teacher, I’d suggest you indulge in some of the great literature concerning the period before you know too much about it to enjoy the books. Thornton Wilder’s Ides of March, though wretchedly inaccurate, is one of the best books that I have ever read, and if it doesn’t stir something within you, you’re not human. I also love Howard Fast’s Spartacus – it’s way better than the movie, and the prose has a liquid beauty, a sensuality even, that will make you beg for more. I saw someone on a different thread suggest John Williams’ Augustus, but I would save that one for later. You need a good bit of background information to feel like you can even breathe while reading it. But it’s pretty good. People will probably hate on me for this one, but Robert Graves’ books I, Claudius and Claudius the God have probably hooked more people on Rome than anything before or since. Read them, enjoy them, and separate the fact from fiction later. I also really loved Jack Whyte’s Camulod Chronicles, especially the first two books, which will give you a great sense of Roman military life and procedures, and also explores Rome’s fading influence in Britain as the Empire falls and the “Dark Ages” begin.  There are so many great options out there, Colleen McCullough’s Rome series, Robert Harris’ Imperium, or Marguerite Yourcenar’s masterpiece Memoirs of Hadrian  to name a few, but just go where your interests are for now. If you absolutely have to dive into the ancient writers, maybe start with Suetonius – his ADHD-esque writing style and focus on all the lurid, gossipy details works well with modern readers. Yikes, this got long fast! Sorry for dominating the message board.

We are ecstatic that you're moving here! We've joked about how great it would be to visit our friends in Portland and accidently stumble upon the witty, engaging Mike Duncan!

Seriously, you've provided so many hours of entertainment (and gotten me through numerous dull lab shifts) you've got to let us treat y'all to dinner. Send us an e-mail! We'll give you until 10/18 before we hound you (gotta respect the nuptial/moving time)

OK, Mike, go ahead and get married. I did it 42 years ago this Sept 25 and I'm still happily married to the same woman. It's a great institution. But please, PLEASE, dump the idea of an American history. They are a dime a dozen. Stick with the ancient eras: Mesopatamia, the Assyrians, Alexander, the Phoenicians... They are all awaiting your deft and witty touch. And there is way less reading to do.
Best wishes on the upcoming nuptials.

Congratulations! It sounds like the next great chapter.

I have listened from the beginning. It has answered so many questions that I have had in understanding Rome, especially before the empire.

There is another podcast that went out several years ago that covered the Byzantine Empire, from 470 to the fall of Byzantium: "12 Byzantine Rulers".  His style was similar to yours by presenting people and events in a way that we can fully understand them.  They seem to still be available for download.

After the Fall of the West I plan to break them out and listen to them again, and I expect a better and fuller understanding.

Re. the decision to fish or cut bait with Romulus Augustus, it's understandable.  The Byzantine Empire really starts to become a different world from Rome, particularly after the end of Justinian's reign.

Still, it'd be cool if you took the leap.

You totally deserve some time off, congratulations.

And welcome to Texas!

As for how this podcast series will end, I kinda feel like there's already a great podcast out there that addresses Byzantine civilization, so why bother. I would much rather hear one or two final "conclusion" episodes where you sort of bring the series to a proper end and maybe give a few personal notes about your podcasting experience.

I know it will be good no matter what you do!

Mike,

I've posted before, and I cant say it enough - THOR is the finest, most meaningful podcast out there.  You have opened my mind up to an incredible history - you have also motivated me to study further the history of an apparently long passed civilisation - in doing so I have found not just tremendous interest but also seen that the probems I (and we) experience today precisely mirror those of the past.  An obvious point I now realise, but not obvious to me up to now.  I'm from England, and possibly older than you.  But when I'm old (hopefully), if I'm ever asked about teachers that have inspired me, Mike Duncan will be high on the list.  That'll confuse the buggers.

I have long thought about posting but the shocking announcement that Imperial Rome doesnt continue to the present day and therefore there would be an end to these podcasts forced me to put fingers to keyboard.

In all honesty you have a gift for podcasting, its a new age skill - how do you write a lesson for an audience on the go? How do you build a relationship with listeners that you will never meet but draw them into your stories, without lecturing (much :-) but by sharing the experience and you certainly have the knack. There are many historians but few storytellers and as your life changes in wonderful ways (my wife told me to say that) you should think carefully before abandoning the podcast airways.

As many have said I would pay for this podcast and would pay for a series say on American history or whatever takes your fancy - because I know what I will get - erudite, passionate history brought to life - a gift indeed. You sir were born to podcast - I say to other people - The History of Rome is like ... well its like .... um ...well ... Exactly.

I hope you have a wonderful wedding and come back to us soon.

Just wanted to say how much I've enjoyed and continue to enjoy your podcasts. Entertaining and informative it's a pleasure to listen to(although at the end of the episode it seems like a week is a long time).As for the continuing with the history after the fifth century I think it would take a lot of time and effort to complete such a task(would begging help?)Congratulations again thanks for the ever excellent podcasts.

Congratulations and best of luck on your upcoming marriage! I don't blame you at all from taking some time off, though I'm glad we haven't reached the end quite yet.

What are you going to be taking in school?

This is quite an old thread by now, but I found your podcast sometime around Christmas 2008 and have been enjoying it immensely ever since.

I echo the thought that you should go back in time and cover the Greek empire next. Both Roman and Greek history fascinate me.

I hope your marriage is being blessed!

Dear Mike, I think you may have crossed your wires for a second when describing how the Parthians forced a Roman army to retreat under the yoke just as the Samnites forced the Romans to do after the battle of the Colline Gate. I think you were referring to the Battle of Caudine Forks which actually did take place during the Samnite Wars and not Sulla’s Civil War. If I’m wrong then I’m sorry but I think that’s what you were trying to say since the Samnites lost the battle of the Colline Gate. Don’t worry I know you just put these in to see if we are paying attention.

Oh, and by the way, “Slaughter mode”… Priceless.

Just to say thank you for such a wonderful podcast.  You make Rome come alive through your wonderful narration style.  I have found your podcasts a fantastic educational aid, much more approachable some text books I have encountered in the past.

On a personal note, you my condolences on the sad loss of your grandfather.  I am sure that he must have been very proud of you, and his part in sparking your interest in history, particularly the roman era.

Thank you again for such a wonderful podcast series.

I'm sorry I only react now, late, of course, two episodes, but ep. 63 features a Roman Colony named "Agrippinanisium" – I think what you mean is my home town, Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis (today's Cologne), so called after the local Ubians decided to apply to the empress to become her clients, leading to lots of Claudii in the region and Agrippina to get her own colony named after her.

HI Mike,

I love your narration style. I have listened to other historical podcasts and audiobooks and yours is the best by far. maybe at the end, you could turn this series into an audiobook!!!

You have a way of keeping it interesting. My only issue is that the episodes are too short and not posted often enough!!!! That's not really a criticism, just an example of my desire to hear more!

Hi, Just listened to podcasts 22-63 in a week whilst on a beach holiday. It hasn't done my marriage much good, but I thought they were all wonderfully presented and a pleasure to listen to - I was a child fan of I Claudius. Can I ask why the podcasts seem to begin at number 22? Am I being daft?

@ David Tait

The RSS feed is fucking with the iTunes users for a long time. There is a limit of 50 posts, after that the early episodes are pushed of the list. That's why the podcast seems to start at episode 22. Mike started to compile the early episodes into bundles in order to fix the damned problem.

The first 20ish episodes can be found at "http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/the_history_of_rome/2008/11/index.html". You'll need to manually download the bundles.

Hope this will help. Also for people who will certainly ask again.

Detlef

ps. Mike mentioned somewhere that he was planning a podcast about the 20th century presidents of the U.S. Not sure if that's still on the agenda. Also there is a small movement to convince Mike to continue into the Byzantine Empire. You might want to look for "12 Byzantine Rulers" at iTunes or Google. It's one of the best Ancient/Medieval History podcast out there. Inspired Mike to start with THoR. IMO ThoR is better that 12 Byz. Rulers. Mike has a great sense of humour. Something which doesn't show on Brownworth's podcast.

Okay, I had to look this up to be sure.  You mention Agrippina's support of one Gaius Rubellius Plautus in the podcast but, unfamiliar with the name, it sounded like Gaius Rebellious Plottus. I thought your dry sense of humor was trying to pull one over on us.

yes please do byzantine history as Byzantium is also known as the later roman empire and there would be nobody better to to the history of Byzantium and there's also the point that everybody is dreading the end and would want your pod casts to last as long as possible getting through my third round of the podcast now i can not get enough

so please let us know would you do the history of Byzantium

To repost one of my above comments in response to the byzantine question.

"Mike mentioned somewhere that he was planning a podcast about the 20th century presidents of the U.S. Not sure if that's still on the agenda. Also there is a small movement to convince Mike to continue into the Byzantine Empire. You might want to look for "12 Byzantine Rulers" at iTunes or Google.

Something which doesn't show on Brownworth's podcast."

Also, 12 rulers is very focussed on specific rulers, unlike the broad swipes that Mike uses to tell his story. A 'History of Byzantium' could very much fill in the gaps left by Lars Brownworth.

And Mike, could you please confirm if you're still planning to do the presidential podcast?

I agree, all of the podcats on Byzantium are just so stale and dont show any of the real drama or comedy which are in Mikes Podcast , Mike i emplore you carry on the good work (even if it is a little further than your original finish line)

p.s was aggripina really aware that her son was trying to kill her or diid she think all the assasination attempts were random accidents (obv apart from the final one)

Hey Mike,

Love your podcast and am a big Julius Caesar fan, so I downloaded the podcasts about his life and am now going back and getting the rest, while also listening to the new ones. I'm a poli sci buff myself and really enjoy your approach. Anyhow, I don't know if you or all the commentators here have seen what Caesar 'actually looked like'.

It's the most ancient bust of the dictator (made while he was alive and not glamorized like later portraits of were). It was found some time last year in the Rhone River:

Hi Mike,
I figured I'd repost this response to ep. 54 up here because I wasn't sure if you would check comments on much earlier episodes.
Colin

Mike,
One quibble from a Latin pronunciation in the episode: the legal term is not "causus belli" but "casus belli"- "the incident of war", with casus pronounced ka-SOOS. The Latin closest in meaning to "cause of war" would be "causa belli".

Other slight errors I noticed in earlier episodes: Hannibal's father's cognomen Barca (this itself actually a romanization of the Semitic baraq as in Barack Obama or Ehud Barak) should be BAR-ka, not bar-A-ka. Also, Cannae is perhaps best pronounced KAHN-eye, not kan-EI, although this is based on the conventional scholastic pronunciation as opposed to church pronunciation.

Anyway, I really enjoy your podcast and can't thank you enough for the time you put into it.
Colin

Hi Mike

in his very entertaining book "The Roman Empire" Isaac Asimov says Nero was the most infamous villain ever to have lived. Caligula was clearly a lunatic, which is not the case for Nero. So I guess that's why Lucius Domitius ranks higher in wretchedness for Asimov.

Also, I noticed that you recommended the BBC series "I Claudius", but you failed to mention that it was based on the extraordinary homonymous novel by Robert Graves. For what I know historiography had considered Claudius a complete ass until "new documents" were discovered in the early XX century, proving that he was a very capable ruler and an extraordinary scholar. Do you know what those documents were and the circumstances in which they were discovered?

Finally, you mentioned tangentially that Tiberius became a lascivious debauched old fart in Capri. However many historians dismiss this based on the spartan habits of his youth. Why would such a gloomy and rather shy character suddenly become a sexual monster in the last years of his life? Especially since viagra was almost 2 millennia away.

I enjoy your effort immensely and spend the whole week waiting for the next episode to be out. Can I recommend that you interrupt the chronological narrative to describe the day-to-day life of a regular Roman? I am curious about domestic matters such as food, clothing, family, etc. I think it would be a valuable addition. Thanks heaps!

Cheers and keep them coming


Augustin

Mike,

My heart goes out to you. Thanks for posting the fishing photo - it speaks volumes. Grandfathers seem so full of graceful wisdom as to be unknowable, in a very ObiWan way. I'm sure he's watching over you from the blue fuzzy afterlife and smiling proudly.

Take care of yourself.

  Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe,
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee.
From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,
Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.
Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,
And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,
And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then?
One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,
And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.

John Donne

Mike, you make a lot of  our lives more enjoyable and learned.  I'm sure your grandpa would be very proud of what you are doing.  Take your time, I know he's tuning in from heaven.

You got a lot of friends wishing you the best here ! It speaks volumes about the quality of your work.  And I'm sure I speak for many of us when I say that I try to turn as many people onto your work as I can.

Whatever you believe in I'm sure your grandfather has gone somewhere good.  All the best to you and your family.

The Sunday night podcast delivery always finishes my weekend beautifully.  I look forward to its return :)

Love the podcast and have been listening since the beginning.

Was wondering if you had considered (or would consider) doing a series of episodes on "Life In Rome." Perhaps a narrative on what a day or the life of people from various social strata would be like. Maybe a few on the culture, mythos and religion, etc.

I know we have a ways to go, but I'm already dreading the end!

Hey très bien podcast. I can think of some other emperors whose reigns and personalities fall in the Claudius-like category. Marcus Aurelius (2nd century) the diminutive philosopher stoic emperor whose wife was unfaithful and whose son and doctors conspired to kill him (according to Dio). Julian (4th century) was also bit awkward, fell into the empire by chance, and was a part-time philosopher and historian. Both were decent top-10 emperors.

My all-time favourite podcast!

One of the many things I love about your podcast is that you care enough about accuracy to include "errata" correcting important errors pointed out in previous podcasts in your later podcasts. (The thing I love most about your podcast, by the way, is your obvious love of a good story - an attribute missing from most modern history textbooks!) I'm not sure if this is important enough to warrant a mention in a subsequent podcast, but for the sake of accuracy, I wanted to point out that Christian tradition actually suggests that an angel of the Lord smote Herod Aggripa not for imprisoning Peter and executing James, but "because he did not give God the glory" when the people of Tyre and Sidon acclaimed him as a god (see Acts 13:20-23).

And, as an erstwhile English teacher, I can't help but point out that "smote" is the past tense of the verb "smite", so your conjugation of the verb "smite" as "smoten" is incorrect.

Thus your phrase, "according to Christian tradition 'smoten by the Lord' for the crime of imprisoning the apostle Peter and executing the apostle James" would be more correctly rendered, "When Herod Agrippa died three years later - according to Christian tradition 'smitten by the angel of the Lord' for not correcting the people of Tyre and Sidon when they acclaimed him as a god for his oratory and for the food he supplied them with..."

Hey Mike,

I thought in preparation for next week's podcast you might take some time out of your no doubt busy schedule to watch the BBC documentary "Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire" as research. In particular the episode which deals with Nero. It shows from the beginning Nero wanted to be a good ruler and was in fact a much loved Emperor and great patron of the arts. He was instrumental in saving Rome during the Great Fire and afterwards was lauded for plans to rebuild the Eternal city as the capitol of an empire of culture and the arts!

Hi Mike, I love your podcast, and I am hoping you will continue right to the end of the Byzantine empire too.

One question has arisen in my mind though, the old pub quiz question, who was the first Roman Emperor? Answer, Augustus, or whichever of his many names you like to give. But since they did not call themselves Emperor, I was wondering who technically was the first? As in the first to call himself emperor and and be called that by his contemporaries? Could it even be someone as late as Charlemagne in 800?

I've been listening to the podcasts from the beginning (just reconstructed the episodes with the old feed so I could get the individual early episodes) and I was wondering...

in one of the early episodes- I think it was Trials and Tribulations, but I might be off- you mentioned the pledge that the plebes were sworn to kill anyone who assaulted a tribune (at least that is as close as I remember it)... and that the promise had been fulfilled more than once. Yet later on, especially around the Social Wars, we see tribunes getting smacked around.

When were tribunes avenged? Did it happen often, or was it more a theoretical thing?

Hey Mike,

A few of your listeners asked you to do next 'the history of Greece'

I found this: <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/classics/introduction-to-ancient-greek-history/">http://oyc.yale.edu/classics/introduction-to-ancient-greek-history/</a>

on I tunes.


We can listen and then tell you how you stack up against Donald Kagan. I've loved your show so much so far, I think Donald may have a hard task.

Thanks for your great show!

(If audible is still your sponsor, can I recommend Cyril Robinsons' History of Greece and Rome-both great listens.)

Will

Hello Mike,

Your podcasts have been a companion for me over the past year and a half.  From the time I subscribed, I have listened to you whilst in hospital waiting rooms during my wife's surgery, in airports, on airplanes, and when I awaken early and do not wish to disturb anyone by putting a light on.

I do hope you will continue the podcasts well into the division of the Empire and through the period until the fall of Constantinople.  Perhaps you might also take up the other thread of the Western Empire with the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.

I truly enjoy your podcasts.

When the publicity on this group first came out, I got several emails from friends encouraging me to use this service. My husband took a family medical leave and did most of the household chores during my five months of chemo. I hope that people who are on their own with limited resources and really need housecleaning help have access to this service, not people taking advantage of "free" stuff trying to "win" a spot at noon. Perhaps the awareness of Cleaning for a Reason inspires friends to offer help to chemo patient directly by actually cleaning, helping with shopping, etc., or by paying for a service (not necessarily this one) to help.

By a suggestion from my dad I started listening to your podcasts and am absolutely blow away by how compelled I am to keep listening. Your voice is calming, the narrative you have written is very followable and well paced and after a month, I'm already on episode 63. I essentially have stopped listening to music altogether in transit, instead just listening to your podcasts.

I'm curious as to what got your started on this, how long it takes you to prepare each week's podcast and how you can find the time to slog through all this information?

BTW... I loved Caligula's 'war' with Brittannia. Class... but I feel pretty sorry for the ppl that had to live through his reign of terror.

I found this weeks episode interesting in the fact, that Mike found the Claudius affairs shocking, as apparently did all of Rome. But, like the Romans historians, all historians tend to be young men, and do not necessarily understand Marriages of Convenience. That is to say, that men having had their children, might marry more for comfort than the illusion of fidelity. Claudius was 48 years old when he married Messalina, who was at best, what? 18?? And, having born two children ostensibly by Claudius, we can thereby understand a bit more of their relationship through their Age differences.
I'd bet he was understanding of her needs, and was loath to condemn her, and only through pressure became convinced as to the necessity of her demise. The question becomes: Who was instrumental in deciding her fate. Claudius would not have deliberately made such a decision. He was much older, more tolerant, and I think...dare I say? A 'relatively normal human being' as we know men today. In a final analysis? I think Claudius did ok. I just wonder what happened to the Guard that murdered her? And, I'd bet 'Sestertius' that that big-mouthed Narcissus won't last very long. ;)

Another great epsiode, Mike! Thanks!

Thanks for that Michael.
I wonder if Mike or anyone else can verify those dates.  I've been hanging out every week for the new episodes since I first stumbled across the series around week 30 and love the lighthearted commentary.  It's amazing to think that western society as we know it is largely what it is because of the Roman Empire, wierdos and all.  Come to think of it, when I look at the nightly news broadcasts, it's not so hard to believe at all.

Mike (from Houston), isn't that a little cynical? Suetonius and others describe the stupor and confusion that Messalina's execution brought upon Claudius. Where as Suetonius deduces a lack of feeling, it appears to me to be shock and depression. I think Claudius' depth of feeling and subsequent disillusionment were as genuine as Augustus' with his daughter Julia.

I really feel for Claudius. These lines from Graves' Claudius the God, uttered by the broken Claudius after he learns the truth about Messalina have always haunted me:

"At the first Games I ever saw (I was acting as joint-President with my brother Germanicus)- Games in honor of my father, you know - I saw a Spanish sword-fighter have his shield-arm lopped off at the shoulder. He was close to me and I saw his face clearly. Such a stupid look when he saw what had happened. And the amphitheatre roared with laughter at him. I thought it was funny too, God forgive me."

Vital the lasting vision
To lay our passing upon a page,
Or better yet a dancing wave.
Still, the everlasting
Will as ever crave,
Insatiably, the mortal wage.
You'll find me long after
The bridge fails to draw,
Long after the castle walls
And monuments, into rubble, fall.
And government, baring the sword,
Falls victim to the burden
Of a worldwide horde.
Now when the skyscrapers
Glass fails to shine
When the three rivers run dry
You'll find me slowly sipping
A fine glass of wine
In salute to captivating all time.
While religion ends in discord
In who's word is truly of the lord.
Just: Akasha has it written
On tablets, no stone chisel bitten,
But by the passion of humanity
Is the mallet driven
In stone tablets of evermore...

Thank You Mr. Duncan

Excellent episode. Made me wonder, had they met what notes on young women Claudius and Henry VIII would have made.

On a more general point. Of the four Claudian Emperors - Tiberius, Giaus, Claudius & Nero - was there one amongst them that did not suffer significant mental health impairment? Both Tiberius and Claudius clearly lost the plot in middle age, whereas Caligula and Nero didn't need half so much time.  I'm sure it's been stated before but my conclusion can only be this: the Claudii - totally nuts, all of them.

Great episode Mike!  And a very nice use of a classic 'Bush-ism'!  Very entertaining! Claudius is an absolutley fascinating figure in history.  I wonder though, is there anything to the idea that Claudius, like his father Drusus, held any republican sympathies?  Also you said that Claudius having mistresses was uummm 'different', is that because he had them or because he didn't just take whomever he wanted like the two princeps before him?  Keep up the good work!  This Sunday won't be the same without a new THoR but I'll be waiting anxiously next Sunday.

Thank goodness I only just stumbled across this podcast series--I can use your brief hiatus to catch up on episodes 1-60. I LOVE what I've heard so far, it's terrifically well done (laughed out loud at the Bush-ism). I second Corey's suggestion for a History of Greece when this one *sniff* is over.

(Also, read the "About" page and was delighted to discover a fellow WWU-er. Hurrah!)

I had a random question about something that's come up a couple of times in these podcasts.  Its often been mentioned that the victims of the various purges faced "Exile or Execution".  But how did exile work in those days ?

Were you just exiled from Rome ? From Italy ? From the whole empire ?

What were the logistics of it ?  Do we have any accounts of who exiles managed to flee the empire, and how they got on in foreign lands (other than high ranking celebrities like Cicero who presumably could fall back on their reputation to ensure they fared well).

I've been working my way through these for months, finally check out the blog, and the fricking guy has handdrawn maps to boot! These are incredibly entertaining and informative, perfect balance between information and informal color. When I get caught up I'm going to go back through them at least one more time from the beginning. I'll be hitting the tip jar too. You have my admiration and gratitude. You have a real talent for teaching. Btw I'm also rewatching HBO's Rome at the same time.

Your show is awesome. If there isn't a new episode I'm listening to the old ones, until the next one comes out. Could you list a Bibliography of the books you are reading? Or at least what you are recommending on Audible. I'm driving to work when I listen so writing the information down is kind of inconvenient. Thanks for making my drive awesome though, and I agree that you should do this with Greece when you are done with Rome.

I realize I'm a year behind (although I just found the podcast two weeks ago, and I've already gone through 800 years of Roman history!) but I had a question on this podcast. What language did Caratacus speak to the Senate when his gave is famous speech? Presumably his native language was some ancient British language, but would he have spoken Latin as well? Or was there likely a translator present in the Senate?

Thanks Mike, I've learned more in the last few weeks than I ever did in several Ancient History classes in school.

I know that Augustus was and is recognized as the first Roman Empiror, but I've been waiting for the official change from "The Julio-Claudian Clan is the royal family of Rome" to "This man is the man you will call Empirator". I haven't heard it yet. In the podcast, The Divine Augustus is always "princeps". Have I missed something?

another great episode. always have and still do wonder how claudius survived to be emperor, i just presumed he sat quietly in the corner while his family and friends were killed for being, well, family and friends of his family. loving the cast for the period comedy, especially britt and jermaine as caratacus anf togodumnus, who would play whom? plus atkinson!? who was born to play narcissus. oh, your shape of the isle of wight leaves rather lot to the imagination (irrelevant i know). just to let you know, i feel the ads don't affect a superb podcast, keep it up.

Hey Mike - I also just discovered your podcasts recently and have been listening to them avidly on my iphone during my weekly 2 1/2 hour road trip to go visit a a project site.  The material is well researched and organized and your delivery is delightful. You even had me laughing out loud once or twice.  Definitely the best podcasts I have ever listened to.  I do have a critism, however - it's the volume.  For some reason, the volume on some/most of the podcasts - espcially No. 60 - is way too low.  I had to push the ear button into my ear and hold it there to be able to hear the podcast. However, this is a problem with your podcasts in general.  I don't seem to have the volume problem with any other podcasts I have ever listened to.  Just wanted to bring it to your attention.  I don't know if anyone else is experiencing the same problems.  Keep up the good work!!!! Am also looking forward to your next series after The History of Rome - whatever that may be.

Hi, another longtime listener here. I've been listening since just before the First Triumvirate I think. Okay. Maybe not that longtime.

But I'd like to say that I thought the podcast would become less interesting after Actium -I'd never had that much interest in imperial Rome before- but you've proven me wrong. The podcast is as fascinating as ever.

By the way, Jeff S has a point about the volume, which used to be a problem for me because I mostly listen outdoors, on buses or trains. What I do nowadays is (if you use iTunes) to adjust the "Volume Adjustment" dial under Get Info > Options about +40%. That makes the volume just right.

Great podcast.  I've been listening since before your 5-month hiatus (looks like a good Latin word, there), and while I've had Cary and Schullard (and Wheelock) at my fingertips since my Roman Empire history course back in college 17 years ago, your podcast gives a framework that makes it a lot easier to wrap my mind around all that information.

Hi,
Just to pick up on the issue of potential landing sites, I think your middle "X" is located somewhere near Chichester. This seems to me to be a very likely landing site given that it was within the area of the Atrebates, the tribe led by Verica. It was his removal at the hands of Britt and Jermaine, I mean Caratacus and Togodumnus, that probably prompted the invasion. The Atrebates, led by Verica, had been sympathetic to Rome, so to land here would have afforded the Romans relatively friendly surroundings as well as a decent natural harbour.
It is possible, though not proven without doubt, that the Atrebates close and loyal links to Rome led to a later king, Togidubnos/Cogidubnos, being rewarded with the splendid villa at Fishbourne, also near Chichester.
Keep up the marvelous work Mike. A few weeks ago I sat within the walls of Pevensey Castle, well okay really the Saxon shore fort Anderitum, and listened to one of your episodes; life does n't get any better than that!

What happened that caused the Senate to stop asserting itself?  I understand the military conquests of Augustus and his subsequent wealth and fame.  But Claudius was near bankrupt and had no military background.  Could you elaborate?

Veronica - Augustus was Princeps because the Romans had a longstanding aversion to kings. He went out of his way to make it appear that the Republic was still up and running. Otherwise he would have gone the way of Julius. He and Tiberius both did this. Later when everyone who remembered living under the Republic was dead and gone, the Emperors dropped the charade.

Hi Mike
Just tracking back and commenting on an earlier episode as I've been meaning to do for some while. I love the podcast in general and it's nice to hear a soft American accent dealing with themes I'd usually associate with a plummy, posh English accent. Even though some of those British place name pronunciations made me laugh! Anyway, just wanted to say how nice it was to hear your enthusiasm for I, Clavdivs. Watching it with my parents on VHS in the 90s really developed my interest in Rome and now, 15 years later, I'm devouring your podcast. Keep up the great work, it's much appreciated.

Yep, I too had chuckle over the pronunciation - but agree with James, the American accent (although I must admit it took a couple of episodes to get used too) is great.
Also have bought the DVD I,Claudius (cheapest I found was at Amazon Marketplace)and am hooked.

Mister Mike,

In a few minutes I'll hoist myself in my uniform to take a plane back to Europe. I kill the hours in between the oceanic reportingpoints listening to your magnificent stories. Not to worry, I only use one earplug (on the other side I'm deaf, no just kidding, but really one earplug), besides it's all cargo in the back, so I don't have to waste time telling anyone about a bumpy ride or so.
But thanks for this entertaining way of bringing a really interesting historic time to life. It shortens the long hours staring in the darkness!!

I have really enjoyed this podcast so far, having just discovered it about three months ago. This episode left me with a question however. You said that Augustus never declared himself divine while he was alive as Caligula did but in an earlier episode on Augustus I believe that you said that he wrote something called "the divine (something)of Augustus" to detail all he had accomplished in Rome. Isn't that the same thing as claiming to be a god? Help me understand

maybe it's too late to change your episode now--or maybe it isn't--but you should know that "spendthrift" means the opposite of how used it: it means one who spends and spends.  "thrifty" is careful with money.  "spendthrift" is someone who is anything but "thrifty."

it's one of those silly things like the fact that "flammable" and "inflammable" mean exactly the same thing, despite what should apparently be the case.

Thanks for this episode, to what extent do you think this was a wasted opportunity to revive the power of the Senate. I know you said the Praetorian Guard was too strong now but I can't help but feel that given the jobs done by the Emperors since Augustus, and everyones expectations about Claudius a senator with the ability of Cicero could have roused the people to such a point that change would have been inevitable.

Claudius wasn't proclaimed emperor that night. According to Gibbon there were "eight and fourty hours" between the murder of Calligula and the ascension of Claudius, when the Senate had control and squabbled amongst themselves, squandering their chance to make Rome a republic again :(

(btw my name is just a coincidence, no relation to the emperor in your upcoming episode ;-)

I doubt the Praetorians would have easily accepted demotion and return to the legions.  Political power comes from barrel of a gun...or unsheathed with a drawn sword.  It is a wonder why no ambitious general didn't try to make a power grab after the chaos resulting from Caligula's assassination.  Legions (as well as Praetorians) can be very political too!  What was the Republic to the common soldier anyhow?  An ambitious general or an emperor paid better, I believe.

Anyway, who remembered life under the a true Republic at this stage of history?  Did anybody believe in the Republic anymore?  Could anybody really turn back the clock?  Did anybody want to?

By this time ther was certainly no senator near the caliber of a Marcus Tullius Cicero but it is interesting that republican ideas still existed even if only as 'pipe dreams'.  Just a suggestion Mike, maybe the next episode takes it's title from Law#21 of Robert Green's 48 Laws of Power (which of course he uses Claudius' story as a perfect example) Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker - Seem Dumber Than Your Mark

Hi Mike, In this episode you mention in passing that one of Caligula's contemporaries that was writing at the time was Seneca.  I know Seneca was a tutor of Nero but what role does he play during the time of Caligula?  I must admit, I don't know a lot about Seneca but his works are on my 'to read' list.  Was he Roman?  I mean an 'ethnic' Roman?  I caught an episode of a BBC series on philosophy and Seneca was the 'Roman' philosopher of the series.  I'm just wondering if Romans are now writing and teaching philosophy and if so, is he the first to do so?  As we go along, it would be great if we could also hear a little about the authors that we draw our understanding of roman history from as we cover the years and circumstances in which they lived and wrote.  Keep up the good work Mike!  This podcast rules!!!

Mike,

Any chance of continuing into the Byzantine Empire? Just asking because 12 byzantine rulers only handled small pinpricks (essentially) of history, whilst you seem you have broad, but detailed strokes in your storytelling.

Amd any plans for a new podcast after this one is finished. On the old blogspot site I read you were planning to do one about the US presidents of the 20th century.

Hi, I am completely addicted.

There is an issue that I just realized I was very curious about but that somehow just got ignored during Augustus' reign. At what point was the title "Imperator" or "Emperor" picked, and for what reason? At one point, it seems we just stop using one title and start using another one. Wasn't "Pinceps" good enough? Thanks,

Great episode Mike! A follow up to Marc Andre's question above, Did Augustus or any of the Ceasars actually use the title 'Imperator'?  I always thought that was a title used by later rulers and applied across the board by historians.  I know the title goes back to, I believe Scipio Africanus, whose troops hailed him as imperator. Also, what were the early years of Caligula's life like?  Robert Graves portrayed him as a 'demon child', is there anything to that?  I hope in the next few episodes we can back track a bit like you did with Julius Ceasar and deal in detail with the early life of Claudius and his relationships with Tieberius, Caligula the rest of his family and those around the imperial family like Sejanus and Herod Agrippa.

Mike (I can call you Mike can't I?),

I've been wondering about the nature of Roman purges from the Late Republic onwards. Were they an empire-wide phenomenon or did they purely effect the citizens of Rome? If Marcus so-and-so was fingered out for execution could he flee to the farthest provinces and therefore escape an untimely death? Or would agents of whoever signed his death warrant track him down and finish the job?

Though I'm a little sceptical about some historical analogies (like compairing the early republic to the founding of the US) But that's probably just my history degree ascerting itsself.

Hey Mike, a few episodes ago you mentioned in closing the cruxifiction of Jesus Christ.  I'm wondering what state is Roman religious life at now?  Where is the common citizen? Where is Caligula at in this aspect and what effects are the eastern cults (i.e. the cult of Isis Caligula is supposed to have been involved in) playing in Roman life.  How does Roman society see the migration of eastern religions (including the Jews) into the Italian homeland?

I have been listening for a long time now, and it's way overdue to join in on the praise for this podcast. It even inspired me to take up a university course on the classical world, which makes me enjoy the material even more. Thank you, Mike!

As others have mentioned, I would also appreciate more theme based episodes, like the Christmas one. For instance on Roman religion, which seems to me a rather complex issue. Or more on military tactics. Or on sponsorship of the arts under the emperors... (Yes, I'm addicted, too).

Awesome Glad you got the podcast up I listened to the first couple minutes and I am glad that the deal with Audible apparently went through I have been waiting for the URL so you get "credit" when I try it out.  Although I have to admit I am waiting to see what Mike in Houston says with his ramblings about "weaties" commercials... but whatever I will keep listening and check out your recomendations (though more likely in print form).
Thanks for the great podcast

Hi Mike,

Another great episode, and I had no problem with the ad at the start. Well done on turning this into some financial gain for yourself.

THOR's Audible recommendations are:

 * Lives of the Twelve Caesars (Unabridged), by Suetonius.
 * The Complete Works of Tacitus: Volume 1: The Annals, Part 1, by Tacitus.

I couldn't find a link on Audible for Suetonius's unabridged version. Might be worth putting a link to your recommendations in show notes so we can add them to our Audible wishlist more easily. :)

Hi all,
I think I read in a previous post by someone that they were worried that post the change from Republic to Empire this podcast was becoming a list of emperors. I think they were worried that less time was spent on culture, the plebs, and the Roman world beyond the ruling class.
I think they may have had a point but I'm still enjoying the podcast. But I heard an excellent podcast: part of the BBCs long-standing In Our Time series. This week's was about The Augustan Age and had a lot about Augustus' influence on culture, particularly poets like Ovid, Virgil, and Horace. It's well worth the listen. The format is having fairly stuffy professors waxing lyrical about their area of expetise, possibly not to everyone's taste but a great and timely  complement to the History of Rome.

I deeply enjoy this podcast, and among other things, I do love the style in which you speak, it is a pleasant shift for one who is used to listening to tons of audio books either monotone or overly dramatic and with a terrible accent. bravo for that!

I have a question..

Who was it that said, "Furthermore, I propose that war be declared on Carthage" after ever speech? was it Cicero? Cato the younger? or Cato the Elder?

if you have time, please email me with the answer at hayes@mises.com

"I think I read in a previous post by someone that they were worried that post the change from Republic to Empire this podcast was becoming a list of emperors."

Actually I was thinking this too.  The show has gotten very Emperor centric.  But then again this span of Emperors... the Claudio-Julian emperors...  is a very famous and interesting saga, and a story that needs to be told.

But I hope you do divert off into other worthwhile stories too.  Vesuvius is due to erupt some time in the next few episodes, for example.

Anything you can do to keep History of Rome going (though I am sure you would keep it going anyway)so the ads are more than welcome. You deserve it!
Also, I recently had a latin exam and while about Roman religion generally, not one event, knowledge gained from your podcast really came in handy!
Thank you!

Hi Mike.  Thanks again for the great podcasts.  The ads are fine too.  Less of a problem than in other podcasts I listen to.  I did have a question question.  What was up with the Legions at this point?  I understand how Sejanus kept the Roman population at bay with fear and intimidation, but wasn't someone related to, friends with, whatever with some charismatic general who tried to swoop in and destroy Sejanus's mere 12k troops?  What kept them at bay?  Seems the army would already be predisposed for an intervention after the death of Germanicus.

Hello,

I've been listening to your podcast since the beginning. Great job!

I have one complain so far, and it's in that last episode, when you talked about the crucifixion of Christ. You talked about it like it absolutely certain it was an historical event. Honestly, I've been reading about the Christ myth theory lately, and I would have really enjoyed a little bit of doubt in that presentation, just a hit that maybe - you know maybe - the story in the Gospels didn't happened exactly as the Bible said it did and that maybe - you know maybe - the historical Jesus wasn't crucified or even that maybe, but hey really just maybe (who knows for real?) there wasn't really an historical Jesus.

And then, if the Christ myth theory is true, the really big event is when that guy who hated jew really badly went on the road to Damascus, had a big sunstroke, and had an hallucination that would reshape the world.

Keep up the good work,

This is about the history of Rome, not theological debates. This podcast is based on what history tells us, it's not really speculation.


That said, I think it's an interesting topic, this just isn't the proper forum to discuss it.

Responding to Venom:

I recently came across the Jesus Myth hypothesis myself and found it very interesting, although I think that there's enough circumstantial evidence to tell us that someone was crucified in the reign of Tiberius whose followers came to believe was resurrected and began a new cult of worship (in the ancient sense) around him.

Paul himself was a jew who persecuted the early Christians as a zealot.  His following, however, was largely made up of gentiles who had converted from paganism.

Hello Mike
Great episode, by the way.
Only recently discovered these podcasts, and am busy catching up. Hooked already though.
Can't help but draw mental comparrisons between Sejanus and J Edgar Hoover, with the way he tried to act as the real power behind the Kennedy's throne, with perhaps a little Macarthy paranoia-sewing thrown in for good measure. Or perhaps I am reading his character unjustly.

This may seem obvious, but (I think) I figured out what I was doing wrong:  1) I never realized that the pan should be really hot before you add the protein, 2) I didn’t remove the protein before cooking the veggies, and 3) I didn’t realize how quickly a true stir fry should cook.  This,asdf of course, resulted in stir fry (beef, chicken, tofu, pretty much any protein I tried) with the texture of shoe leather.

Great episode Mike!  I really like the addition of pics to the series.  Now, why exactly would Germanicus enter Egypt without the permission of Tieberius if it was so well known that no one could do so without his expressed written consent?  Did he just simply overlook that rule or did he have an ulterior motive in doing so?  Or is that a question there is no clear answer on?  Also, would his Pro-Counselor authority not shield him from that rule?

Your podcast is outstanding.  Do you think you would ever do a blog or episode about movies/tv shows about Rome and which ones are relatively factually correct?  I've only seen the HBO Rome series and I thought they were great.  They glossed over a lot of information, of course, but that's why we have your podcast right?  Keep it up.

one more thing I forgot to ask, I would love to buy a CD from you with all the episodes on there, maybe edited to subtract the intro/outro guitar, but still leaving one track per episode.  Is this something you would ever consider doing?  Probably when your finished with the whole series, keep it in mind because I would definitely go for that.  I really appreciate all the work you have put into this, it makes doing yard work *MUCH* more entertaining.

Hey great suprise getting the podcast early this week.  I love the Germanicus story and got the book "Killing Ceasar" by Stephan Dando-Collins, I was wondering if you read any of his books.  He did a great book called "Nero's Killing Machine" and he detailed The Battle of Watling Street that turned back the revolt by Budica that should be showing up in the next couple podcasts.  I can't wait to hear your take on the Romans in Britannia and the revolt of Budica.

What is it that makes a guitar easier to play than other guitars? And what is it that makes it sound good?
What are the factors that make one guitar easier to play than another? I play guitar and I've noticed that some guitars are just easier to play.

I felt compelled to come on here and express my thanks for making my most favouritist (thats a word right) podcast.
I ripped through the 60ish previous podcasts in days and now having to wait a week for each new episode is torture!
My only complaints.... Make the podcasts longer and more frequent (but thats just me being selfish)

So again, thanks for producing this brilliant series and keep it up :)

As we are just about there, I was wondering if you will be covering St. Peter.  I know he isn't a Roman and that Christianity is not yet substantially influencing the Empire but this is a pretty huge figure that is about to drop right into the city.  It would be a shame if he were completely ignored.  Especially since Spartacus got a whole episode without doing much more than making himself a bullet point on Crassus and Pompey's resumes.

Hi Mike,

Jese I just read those deeds and that guy didn't hold back on shouting about himself. It seemed more a advertisment for the Octavian Corporation than anything else! I'm surprised he didn't add 'And the senate in their infinite wisdom without a single threat from myself upon them, decreed that I was actually the first son of a one true God and shall forever be remembered thus.'

Ahem similarities with the oh so vain Mark Anthony anyone!?

Haha keep up the good work Mike.

A fantastic series, a real labour of love, but, Mike, why not suggest that your listeners actually (shock horror)READ the books, I Claudius and Claudius the God, by Robert Graves. Don't know if they are still in print but should be in libraries and on Amazon.

@ Carolyn,

I dug around quite a bit trying to get the battle straight in my head and then recount it without getting too bogged down in the details. Having seen the experts reenact the attack, do you think I pulled it off OK? Do you have any pictures of the site you'd be willing to share- I'd love to post them with the episode.

Dear Mike

I've been listening to your podcast from the start, but never posted a comment. Thought I ought to since I must've listened to the series all the way through about ten times! How sad am I? :) The series has only gotten better and better and I've learnt so much.

'I Claudius' is indeed awesome. Livia is the best thing in it. This podcast is every bit as awesome. I look forward to the next installment, as always.

@ Bowdezafa

I would highly recommend reading the ancient historians (Livy, Polybius, Plutarch etc)- that's where all the good stuff is buried. Good luck on the project, the world has always needed a good Roman comic book. I would love to see what you come up with.

I discovered your podcast just before I left the States for a tour of duty in Iraq. I try hard not to listen to more than one or two a night so I can maximize the number of days that I can enjoy them, but I am certain I will be listening to them over again before my tour is up. Thanks for such a great program! I was stationed in Italy for over 4 years (end of 2000-beginning of 2005)and loved studying and walking the streets of Rome. Keep up the great work! Fai bene!!!

Absolutely loving the podcasts and had serious withdrawals during the break in the program a few months back, managed only with the help of the '12 Byzantine rulers' series of podcasts.

Yes, enjoyed the BBC version of I, Claudius, however Robert Graves' book is a must read (as is his autobiograpgy 'Goodbye to all that') and other writings.

Mike:  I just discovered this podcast last Friday and I'm enjoying learning about Rome during my morning walks, and now during my commute.  Thank you!  I have to tell you that you faked me out a bit during the bit in the Second Samnite War episode about Quintus Fabius in the Ciminian Forest.  When you made the "Rodents Of Unusual Size" comment, I hadn't yet tipped to your sense of humor, so I was amazed to "find out" that the "Princess Bride" scene must have come from an actual Roman legend.  Then I heard your deadpan delivery of lines like "...at least they could be the subject of another podcast..." and "...this is the same strategy that worked so well for the Rebel Alliance against the Imperial Walkers on Hoth...".

I'm almost to the bit about the Battle of Cannae - one of the few bits of Roman history I actually remembered - and I look forward to catching up.

By the way, Chris from Australia:  If you liked the "12 Byzantine Rulers" podcast, I highly recommend Prof. Kenneth Harl's "World of Byzantium" lectures from The Teaching Company.

Great episode as always Mike!  I have a question for you though.  I just finished reading Anthony Everitt's Cicero and came across a few aspects of Roman society that I was not familiar with.  Mainly, the practice of human sacrifice in times of distress.  While I was aware of the brutaluty of the age, I wasn't aware that they took part part in this practice.  I believe the story the author refrenced was about several Greeks that were buried alive after the defeat at Cannae.  A) is that account acurate?  B) If so, how wide spread was this practice within the society and why is it a subject that is brushed aside?  I think it's common knowledge that other cultures around the world have taken part in this sort of thing but I've never associated it with that of the Romans or the Greeks for that matter.

Mike:  Thanks again for the podcasts.  I'm up to the end of the Third Macedonian War now, and I've had some thoughts and questions.

I've been looking up names of people and places that I don't know, which means almost all of them.  Since the spelling is often quite ambiguous, this can take a nontrivial amount of time.  It occurred to me that if I took a moment to annotate your entries, my effort would prove useful to others.  Should I post any names I find - along with a Wiki link - on the comments for the episode?

Yesterday I was taking notes on a map printout in the hope that this would help me learn and retain the information.  Again, it occurred to me that such efforts could be useful if shared.  I'm considering making a Google map for each episode and linking to it in a comment.  Do you think this is a good idea?

I recently finished the audiobook Caesar's Legion: The Story of the X Legion. I was confused when reference was made to the 17th and 18th Legions around the time of the Jewish Revolt, AD 67-70. The book also states that the legions involved were likely the 19th, 25th, and 26th. The author supposedly used contemporary sources, but most of the online sources I found agree with Mike, that the 17th thru 19th were wiped out in the Teutoburger Wald.

Can anyone offer clarity on this?

hey there man - love your podcasts, i've been a romanaphile - actually more like a romanojunkie - since childhood, but i've learned some new and great stuff listening to you... i've probably missed it but is there somewhere where you cite your sources?
also - i've always wondered about this: did the roman legionaries actually wear *sandals* in the German winter? in the above pics they are but i find it hard to believe that they could've done so... in WWI and II soldiers were getting frostbite wearing wool socks and boots... so what's the story?
anyway thanks a lot for all your work and the handrawn maps and all - keep it up... what are we going to do after the fall of Constantinople??

Hi Bennett--it was me that took the photos; a friend of mine used to live near the battle site and she invited me out for the reenactment a few months after I'd badgered her to take me there on an earlier visit.  We had a fantastic time--I cheered for the Romans and she cheered for the barbarians, since she's a descendant from them on her father's side.  Re sandals--I've seen reenactors and models in museum exhibits wearing rabbit fur (fur side in) between their sandals and their feet, and the sandals excavated in Germany were actually a little more solid than the standard calligae.  Have a look here for examples:

Salve Mike,
Was the website you referenced for the map of the site of the Teutoburg Forest livy's.org?  I can't find it. I've got Livy's History of Rome under a variety of listings. No map yet.  I'm cautious to say for certain and then find it as soon as I post this.
Perhaps you have a lead for me?
Thanks, Val
ps I've got your map of Augustus Provinces and the senatorial provinces as my screen saver perfect reference material.
I really appreciate the maps and wow on Carolyn's pictures.  What a lot of work it must have been just to prepare the armor and tools, weapons and horns, did you see that long horn and the clothes.  Amazing.

The missing link in the "Livia killed everyone" theory is that she did not act alone. To ignore the hidden hand is to see only the surface of the 'fate' that put easily controllable Tiberius on the thrown. A puppet to such an extreme degree he spent the last decade outside of the city! The true power players remain hidden, they act through their front men, sometimes using deliberate sacrifices like Brutus, sometimes ones who are agents for the inner circle like Livia. The same kind of front me are used by this very same, but immensely expanded shadow governance. "His" story becomes much more clarified when the hidden hand, and it's nefarious motive and intent, comes into focus.

Surely if Drusus and Tiberius were only (planned to be) temporary heirs they should be "heirs presumptive" not "heirs apparent"?

Would the Romans have referred to the emperors using the names we use now, or are they a later invention?

I would like to add a follow up to Lain's question, though it may be a bit premature.

Did the later Julio-Claudian Emperor's keep the title of Princeps?  Or did the use the more formal Caesar or Augustus.  I know that by the time of Diocletian they were using the latter titles but I also know that Princeps eventually became Prince in Italy and beyond.

Another great podcast.  Tough job sorting through the confusing politics here and it only gets tougher as Rome adopts a revolving door policy for its Emperor's.  Looking forward to it.

Hmmm... I have mixed feelings about progressing into the Imperial age.  Previously, it seemed like we were talking about a society and a culture that strove to make its way in the world and thrive, but now, it seems like we're descending into a list of names and family intrigues that will just string itself out over the next 400 years until it dies.  Is there anything that we, as modern citizens, can learn from the Imperial age?  Only Mike can tell us.

Dear Mike,
First of all, thank you for your fantastic podcast! My husband, my son (age 12) and I here in Rome, Italy have been avid fans since its beginning.
You asked  in your last podcast for comments on going "slightly" commercial. Frankly, we are sure you will continue to ensure the high quality and integrity of the podcasts - with or without sponsorship. So, as there is little your fans can do other than lavish praise upon you and your work, we think your true fans will hardly begrudge you some financial recompense!!! Anyway the proposed sponsor has many brilliant products, so GO AHEAD!
Kindest regards from Rome (and look forward to hearing my surname in a future podcast...),
Alison Macro

I want to say that I really appreciate your show. I think you deserve to reap the rewards of your hard work. So by all means take the offer from audible.com but keep it short. I think a great example of this is BuzzOutLoud. Despite being around 40 minutes long, they have one short pre-recorded ad during their podcast. It is so short that it is not even worth fast-forwarding. At the other extreme is Leo Laporte. He goes on and on for a ridiculous amount of time (not pre-recorded). I always fast-forward through his shows. Lastly, because of the structure of your shows I think it would be best to put the ad at the beginning, maybe after you introduce that episode's topic. At the end would be too easy for people to skip and in the middle would break the flow.

I am exited about moving in to the imperial period, I loved reading the "I Claudius" books by Robert Graves (Grieves?), and I'm exited to get a less florid, (but I expect no less entertaining)  version of the Julio-Claudian dynasty from you.

Hey Mike!  I have a thought about the self-imposed exile of Tiberius.  You mentioned that is was telling that while he stepped down from an official office he did not relenquish his tribunate powers.  While that could be used to step back into power at a later date it could have also been used as a defensive mechanism if Tiberius did truly wish to retire from the public eye.  Surely considering the times he and his mother Livia came of age in they would have had a clear understanding that if Augustus did die, whether Tiberius wanted to retire or not, he would find himself in the center of it all.  Either as the new first citizen of Rome or as the number one marked man on the list of "must go's" for whatever new power crazed general that filled the vacuum left by Augustus.  As much as the tribunate powers could be used to gain power, they could have been equally used as a shield to protect and assure the safety and peace of his retirement.  I'm not sure that this act is a nod in either direction of what Tiberius' intentions may have been.

Dear Mike,

I have just started listening to your podcast and have burned my way through all of your episodes in about a week, listening pretty much non-stop every chance I get.

This is essentially my first foray into studying Roman History and I feel that your podcast is quite possibly the best way I could've done so, and will be recommending it to others.

As mentioned this is my first time reading or hearing Roman History and one thing that struck me is the way that almost every individual, from Romulus onwards can never be characterised as being a pure hero or villain. Those that did things that on the surface may seem great and selfless were often done to curry public favour, or were done at the expense of other's lives, and those that categorically ignored the rules, laws and traditions were often doing it because they felt it was the only way to defend their city, their republic or their constitution.

Is this something you deliberately set out to do, to not present things in black and white terms, and is this approach common within Roman scholarship? Because it is something that I really appreciate.

As to the commercials, I think it is absolutely fine, but I do hope that this podcast does not become too much like a job and not enough like a hobby or a passion, because your enthusiasm for the subject is something that I truly admire.

I've been listening since Episode 42 and I can't thank you enough for the knowledge I've gained. I usually listen twice to make sure I've got a good understanding of what's going on. I'll have to print out the family tree before I listen to this episode a 2nd time.

I plan to go back and pick up the first 41 episodes as I have time too.

Thanks again.

I, like most, love the podcast.  I have a suggestion for an episode for a rainy day in the future.  How about a special episode on the history of gladiators and games.  There is much information available as well as much MISinformation.  I'd love to here an episode with your perspective on the truth.

I have read the Graves books as well as seen the miniseries at least a half dozen times.  It never bores me and I keep trying to get my wife to watch as I think she would get hooked as well.

Excellent podcast--I have learned quite a bit, despite having taken a college level course on Roman History.

Mike,
One quibble from a Latin pronunciation in the episode: the legal term is not "causus belli" but "casus belli"- "the incident of war", with casus pronounced ka-SOOS. The Latin closest in meaning to "cause of war" would be "causa belli".

Other slight errors I noticed in earlier episodes: Hannibal's father's cognomen Barca (this itself actually a romanization of the Semitic baraq as in Barack Obama or Ehud Barak) should be BAR-ka, not bar-Ak-a. Also, Cannae is perhaps best pronounced KAHN-eye, not kan-EI, although this is based on the conventional scholastic pronunciation as opposed to church pronunciation.

Anyway, I really enjoy your podcast and can't thank you enough for the time you put into it.
Colin

On advertising in your podcasts. I say go ahead as long as you give the option of skipping over the ad. iPods allow this but I think you have to add something to the podcast. The thing is I listen to a lot of podcasts and Audible advertises in almost all of them. So it gets tiring having to listen to the same advertisements all the time.

Thanks for the great podcast/netcast!

Mike, I don't think advertising would be such a bad thing, unless you did it in the middle of the podcast. But if you started each episode with "Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Sponsored by Audible.com. Episode #." Just A thought, but I really love your podcast and it seems fair that you get some sort of compensation for it. I know I'd listen to your podcast even if I had to sit through a a minute or two of ads, and I'm sure most of your fans would.

As long as the quality is good and your sense of humor is dry I see no reason why you shouldn't turn a profit. Having said that, if you are making some money on this should the fans expect any changes? Is audible going to insist on longer episodes, more frequent episodes, more detailed episodes? I don't know the terms of the deal and I am just curious.

I think that if you'd like to make a little extra money while you're doing this 'cast every week, go for it.

I think an added incentive for you to go the extra mile and finish the next 400 years (hell, I think you should go into Byzantine history as well, since it is my favorite stretch of history and to be honest, it is another 1000 years..) is a great idea.

I say go for it, definitely.

no worries about a little advertising. there are audible.com plugs on dan carlin's hardcore history and it doesn't spoil it. as long as its before or after, and not in the middle of the podcast.

As long as the ads are not annoying and nothing bothers you about the terms of the deal I would do it. Getting financially compensated for what you enjoy is good sense.

But beware "you can not serve two masters" and money has the habit of slowly moving enjoyment to the side to become the sole master of projects.

I've been a regular listener for almost a year now.  I agree with most of the other comments about accepting the advertisements.  You've been providing a great service for free and if you need/want the money to keep providing it to us for free then go for it.  I also agree that they should be subtle.  That is to say at the start and/or end of the podcast.  Once the episode gets going I don't want it to be interrupted.

Keep up the good work.

With regards to Audible ads: I listen to a large number of podcasts that are sponsored by Audible. The key is to recommend a book that's relevant to the topic (I've already bought The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire :)).

In fact I'd love it if Audible would let you narrate a book. It's a shame you didn't narrate Gibbon's book because the Audible guy makes it sound dull!).

Mike, you have been brightening up my Monday mornings for a while now and I think you have a good product (economically speaking) in the podcast.  I have also been an audible.com member for a couple of years and enjoy it immensely, so I would see no conflict or incongruity in hearing about audible on your podcast.

That being said, you should consider whether you like audible.com enough to promote it.  If you do, for sure, tell the world about it.  Any as you said "money cant buy you happiness, but it can buy you control of a Mediterranean empire." So monetize away, I'll only be happy for you!

I listen to several podcasts and sponsorship is reasonable common.  Dan carlin's hardcore history is sponsored by audible, podicitionary is sponsored by gotomypc, and This American Life has a few sponsors.  I don't find it intrusive as long its reasonable.  Please continue to keep all the old episodes available.   I refer people to the show and you really need to be able to start from the beginning.

When you sign up for audible, you get a free audio book.  Dan Carlin's hardcore history is sponsored by audible, and his audible advertisements are personalized a bit by Dan recommending what free book you should choose (e.g. Julius Ceaser's Commentaries).

Personally, I don't mind advertisements.  And of course, we listeners would all be better off if you, like Dan Carlin, were a full-time podcaster.  Spending 5% of your time on advertisements and asking for pledges, like Carlin does (e.g. a buck a show, it's all we ask), wouldn't be overdoing it in my opinion.

As if you needed any more encouragement about sponsers:
Go for it! Most of the top podcasts are sponsered by someone or other, usually audible. I'd also like to second Lisa's idea that you should combine it with an (audio)book recommendation - that turns an ad spot into something useful. You deserve a bit of remuneration anyway.

Do what you love.  The money will follow.  Who are we, your audience, to argue with the wisdom of fate?  I see no reason you should not make as much profit as possible from the work you have done.  And, getting a recommendation for a good Audible book from you each week would only add to the enjoyment.

g'day mike
i consider THoR  to be THE BEST podcast currently offered and if it requires advetising to have it continue (hopefully up untill byzantium and the fall of constantinople... i know..... lots to hope for) then so be it.
we appreciate the efforts that you have put in and anticipate every episode.
as a grateful listener and learner i have a request.... that the advertisement be mentioned only at the start or end (my preference) of each episode ( both... if they pay more)
in australia we have a public broadcaster that has introduced ads in the middle of documentories. and the storey falls .. octavian agrippa ceasar augustus who???  did what??..... so please do not break the narrative!
THoR belongs to you mike, and if you deem to make a quid from it, or not, is entirely up to you
if anyone hasnt been to 12 byzantium emporers...google now
 cheers, mike, looking forward to the next installment of (my-think) octavian-augustus

Hello Mike,
I've been enjoying your podcast for a long time now: first catching up with the first 35 episodes or so when I knew of the existence and now listening to the new episodes every monday.
Although I'm not really in favour of advertisements in the podcasts, I see my fellow listeners to be much less abhored by the idea. I think it depends a lot on what the advertisements are about.
It is really interesting to see how you establish your 'version' of the history of rome. Anyway, it would also be nice to get insight in which source material you use. Does it change much from episode to episode, or are you just following one or two well known sources?
Is it mostly primary sources (like Livy and Suetonius), or the secondary recounts which gained their authority over time?

Mike,

I have been a loyal listener for years and thought I'd give my two cents on the subject of sponsorship as well.  Go for it, man!  It is honorable that you have given us all such an enjoyable weekly podcast for years now and it seems only fair that you receive some compensation for your outstanding work (I'm sure the future Mrs. THOR wouldn't mind either).  I would gladly listen to a few seconds (or minutes) of sponsorship copy if I knew you were being fairly compensated for what you have done... you've been more than fair to your listeners since the beginning and, listening to the ad copy, would be one way we could be fair back.

Mike-I'm with everyone else here; if people are willing to give you money for doing something you love, and it doesn't affect the final product, go for it!  As an added bonus, this should ensure that us loyal listeners won't have to endure another loooooonnnnng hiatus from you, since your employers at audible.com probably wouldn't allow it :)
Also, it was a good idea from whoever suggested it about book recommendations.  I was curious about your sources as well, whether you were going straight from the primary sources or later ones.  It was because of this podcast that I went out and bought Polybius, Livy, Virgil and Caesar's Gallic Wars Commentaries (haven't gotten to the Civil Wars just yet).
As someone commented above, Dan Carlin's plugs for audible.com on his podcasts aren't distracting at all and I'm a big fan of his listing of sources on his website.

As always, Mike, fantastic work and congratulations on the recognition and increased interest in the podcast, it's by far my favorite and you deserve whatever people are willing to give you!

Good day Mr. Duncan, I hope all is well in the land of THoR.  I appreciate the work you have done for your listeners, and look forward to the masterful story telling you have planned for us in the future.  I was saddened when I had read of a 5 month abdication of your duties on the biography page of this website, and fear to lose my teacher altogether following the end of his 5 month hiatus.  I prey this not be so, and truly I do not know how I might respond to a new narrator, being so accustomed to your superior style of oration.  I say superior sincerely stacking your production high above the podcasts available otherwise, concerning history of the ancient world, i.e. Jennifer Lockett's, Dave Kaliva's, the history channels, & et. al.  Yours is not the only show in town, but still the most consistent and long standing with Lars Brownworth's Byzantine History podcast coming in a close second.  I am a student, and love learning.  I find your podcast to be satisfying on this account, and believe the professionalism you put into this podcast to be deserving of accolades, and furthermore some pirates treasure is due your way for this work.  Unfortunately, I would have to stop listening if a fee were levied on your listeners.  Once again, you deserve the booty, but  I am as the  former slave princess in Voltaire's Candide that is I have just one cheek to spare, and spare it I shall not.  Commercials from audible? I don't care so long as THoR lives on, and specifically if you remain his incarnate, and not abdicate this high office to another.
I highly value you as my teacher, and look forward to your insight into history in the future.

I have found that the Audible adverts are not a bad thing, usually the folks "reading/making up on the fly" them do the ads at the beginning and the end.  It is not intrusive at all to have them in that format.  That being said, it becomes a question of do you want to get some money for the show, thus being "tied to the man" (even if you are not it might make you feel like it) or do you want to continue to do it for fun.  The choice in the end is completely up to you, but I will likely continue to listen and keep it on my ipod (as I did during the hiatus)no matter what.

I know it has be mentioned already, but on the topic of ads... In a perfect world I would prefer no adverts, but if they are not terribly intrusive please take the opportunity.  Dan Carlin's podcast has ads from Audible which I do not mind (that much).

Hello Mr. History of Rome!
I've been an avid listener from the start and really appreciate all the time and energy you put into the podcast for us. I listen to you as I'm fixing up our old house or walking to class. As a science and history teacher of 12 year olds I really appreciate your upbeat and clever delivery of some potentially dry material (who else can make grain ecomomics/politics sound so fascinating?).

Well, I didn't just write to say how awesome you and the podcast are (very, by the way), I wrote to give my wholehearted support of the offer of cash for your work. Go for it! Not meaning to sound too rude but I'd rather audible be throwing their money at you than at some of the other drivel out there. You deserve it, and I bet we'll still be listening even if you urge us to try Soilent Green or something.

Thanks again and again.

So as a guy thats literally listened to ALL of your episodes more than once, I would not be bothered in the least if you took on a sponser to compensate you for you time. Just don't hit me with the ad in the middle of the episode or I'll end up hating whatever product interrupted my monday morning  mantra!!! THANKS AGAIN FOR COMING BACK! Long live Mike....

Hi Mike,

Love the podcast!  As for the Audible.com advertising, another podcast I like has just recently added it to their episodes (Slate's "Political Gabfest").  Although I actually like Audible.com, the way that they've added the advertisements to the middle of each episode really throws me off; maybe it's because it interrupts the normal flow of their conversation, or just causes me to think about topics unrelated to the podcast episode.  In any case, I've just about stopped listening to them, pretty much because the advertising kind of ruins my enjoyment.

If you do go with the advertising, I'd ask that you keep the main body of each podcast free of it, if possible.

Thanks,

--John

Hello Mike

I have discovered the history of Rome a few weeks a go and since i am a big Fan of Roman History Absolutely love your Podcast. it is one of the most popular podcasts out there today. I think from my point of view is not a bad idea. The show is popular and advertising will not reduce (i think) the amount of listeners. I personally would not mind listening to some ads. Especially since you have done such a large part

Advertising is fine, I mean, it could be another way for you to expand upon the show. If you make an agreement where you get to promote topical Audio books, say something in reference to that weeks show.
I see it as totally fine, as long as it comes at the beginning of the show. Awesome podcast, and keep up the good work!

Re: Ads

It won't turn me off, but it won't turn me on, either. I would file it under "necessary evil"; frankly, you do fine (audio-wise) on your own.

IF you decide to make this arrangement, I would invite you to listen to two of my favorite other podcasts, podcastle.org and escapepod.org (both produced by the same company), for both how and how not to do this sort of ad. Podcastle's are lifeless, obvious, and mechanical, but on Escape Pod - at least those done by Alister Stewart - are interesting enough that I didn't even know I was listening to an add until it was too late.

As for the ads, I have no inherent objection to them.  However, I'd like to know exactly what the ads would entail.  I would have absolutely no objection to you personally recommending a book from audible (as long as it is at least tangentially related to the subject matter).  However, those recommendations must be YOUR opinion, not the paid opinion of Audible.  If the ads are scripted by Audible, like radio style ads, that's okay as long as they aren't too intrusive to the podcast (no more than one interruption during the podcast, at most, and even that I would find irritating, but probably not so much that I would stop listening.  But more than once is too much.)  Ads at the beginning and end are fine, and not terribly unexpected these days.  If the ads are stripted, how long would they be?

Here's some ammo for you to take back to Audible.  I am a current member of Audible.com and a book recommendation from you would be very helpful to me in finding new reading material listed there. I doubt I'm alone.

That said, you should definitely go for the Audible deal.  (They're pretty tasteful with their approach to ads.)

You're a class act for asking the listeners, BTW...

i see no problem with a "partially brought to you by" type announcement in the beginning or ending of each podcast.You deserve to be compensated.Also,if it could help finance putting it into readable book form one day i say yes.
there's one way to settle this though going by where you are right now

What Would Augustus Do ?

if a large country came to Augustus and said "we'd like to help finance your campaign/fight your war as long as you let them know we helped you"  would he accept ? would he reject ?

Definitely would support you getting some money for the high quality content you provide.  As someone stated though, make sur the contract doesn't bind you too much and that you keep your independence, else you might start to lose your control over this podcast.

That being said, sign up the deal!! :)

Hello Mike,  I think advertising on a podcast can be done in a way that there is little affect to the integrity of the show.  I know Audible.com has advertised with many other podcast shows, most notably in my mind would be Dan Carlin's Hardcore History.  As long as the advertisement is at the beginning and the end of a podcast I think it'll be ok.  Now with that said, this particular podcast is by far my favorite and I would absolutely love to see it remain as is so that all the episodes are consistent and timeless.  I would also like to add one other point, if podcasting is an avenue you would choose to persue as a profession I believe you would be quite successful.  While this subject matter is a hobby and passion of mine, your witt and delivery style would surely make me intrested in any other shows or topics you may choose to present.  Best of luck with whatever you choose to do, I'm sure it'll be great.  Now to this episode, I think the first point that jumped out to me was the idea that Augustus would make refrence to a law inacted by none other than Marcus Antonious, that man who he just finished erasing from existance.  Add to that his absurdly hypocritical adultery position and you see that good old Augustus hasn't strayed far away from that 'do whatever to advance his position' Octavian.  But hypocracy is of little concern to a monar...., I mean emperor.

I listen to a couple of podcasts that have audible ads in them.  I don't find them to be a problem as long as they don't interrupt the main narrative, say in the beginning, or in the wrap up.

I really do enjoy your podcast, it's one of the most enjoyable history ones I've found.  So many of them sound like someone reading the subject for the first time on wikipedia(I heard a biography of Patton pronounce the town Bass tog knee...).  It takes a good knowledge of a subject to speak casually about it (correctly, anyways), and you do.  It's like shooting the breeze with a friend about the subject

I had a lot of knowledgeable things to comment on concerning this episode of THoR, but they now pale in comparison to the last minute of the Wheaties Commercial offer that you made, so I will not make the intended comments...which is indeed the sadness.

I usually listen to THoR the Sunday night (for me) that it is published...I could not.

And, so...I have the dubious opportunity to see and to read how of your many fans feel like, "What? Me Worry? It's all good."...and I am sorry to say, that find they're opinions equally dubious...indeed Odious.

You of course realize that by selling your rights, that:
#1) We have covered over half of the Roman Empire History.
#2) By implication, We have less than half to go.
#3) Many of us have contributed, as best we can to support your efforts. Many of us feel that an History is being made thru your efforts. One that is only just beginning to Ring Thru our History!
#4) By acceptence of the Corn-Flake offer, you for-go our earnest and heart-felt support. And, thus surrender any historic achievement at all. It's just a sponsored Corn-Flake commercial, after all...
#5) You become an object of their lessons. And, should you stray from what is their intended message? You must conform, or lose their support, yes? Of course.
#6) Your message becomes that which they wish to convey, and whether that is true or not? Your message, briefs, podcasts becomes so many Corn-Flakes commercials...for how shall we determine which words are yours...and which are Professor Corns-Flakes?!? We cannot determine it.
#7) Therefore? You either finish this as a Man, in whom we invest much...Or? Just another commercial klown and watch subscribership fall, beginning with myself.

Finish it? Own It? You determine it.
Sell it now? You were bought...and very cheaply.

I had my say...Now? Your Choice,
Michael In Houston

Your not going to finish College or get your degree, cause you got an offer...

So, like a good father I am going to offer one last peice of advice.

Finish your education 1st! The NFL will still be there.

Finish this? World is your Oyster and The Pearls look good.

Do not? And, after this season? What else will you ever be?

Finish what you started, as you started.

I think you should go with the adverts, provided you are comfortable with the company’s demands. You deserve the bonus for your dedication to this brilliant podcast.

Can't help joining the clear majority here.  I've been a constant listener since episode 12 or so and was honored that you consulted us.  I say go for it, you deserve the cash. However, not to sound to greedy but, do we get anything out of the deal? Longer episodes? More frequent episodes? Another podcast on the side? Imperial Presidency, Byzantine Empire or History of the Star Wars Galaxy are a few suggestions.  Either way, you certainly deserve the cash for this and audible ads don't bother me in other podcasts.

Thumbs up on ads, particularly audible ads.

I'm used to listening to them on a couple of Leo Laporte tech podcasts, such as This Week in Tech (TWIT).  I actually look forward to the audible book recs he features each week, but he's always got guests to help out.

I first learned about audible from his podcasts, soon free trialed them, then went platinum.  I love audible.

It couldn't be a better fit with a serious but entertaining history podcast such as yours.  Kudos to you for being asked by them. Only tangentially related ads would be more annoying, but Audible fits like Johnny Cochran's glove. Again if you recommend some history books each week that are on Audible, so much the better. Then even as a subscriber I'd WANT to listen to the ads each week.

I suggest you weigh at least twice as heavily those who are accustomed to listening to podcast ads, over those that aren't.  Weigh especially heavily those who have heard audible ads.

They approach being a public service for those that aren't familiar.  I've subscribed to them for over two years and still don't mind hearing them.

No I'm not in any way affiliated.

Mike, if taking on advertising makes things easier, then go ahead and do it.

My only concern is that you retain the rights to what you have done, and that you retain control over what happens.

As people have pointed out, others advertise Audible in their podcasts, and it hasn't been overly obtrusive.

I've heard a similar plug by Dan Savage in his "Savage LoveCast". It's short and to the point because it's at the beginning of the programme, it doesn't interrupt the flow. If you have the opportunity to do the same and get some cash for all your hard work then well done and go for it!

Re: Sponsorship.

I am a loyal follower of your show, but I am also a regular listener of Slate Magazine's podcasts. They have also recently entered a relationship with Audible.com, and the hosts' weekly increasing bitterness is clearly evident. I personally blank out during the ad portion, and find it a huge distraction from the show's actual content.

I understand the appeal of a sponsor, but a relationship with Audible has the potential to spoil your podcast if ads are forcibly inserted at the beginning or middle.  If you put it at the end, I wouldn't have an opinion - but that's only because I'd just turn it off.

To add to the chorus above, of COURSE you should take the sponsorship.  A minute or two of ads never really put anybody out too much.
I never left a comment before but I guess now is as good a time as any to thank you for all the great work you have been putting in on the podcast.  I have enjoyed it immensely so far and am particularly happy to be moving into the imperial period which I know next to nothing about-I guess it's not so fashionable right now.
It is good for this scientist's mind to think some cerebral thoughts once in a while.  Also, the maps are a great addition.

Hey Mike,
Awesome podcast. Agree with the above re the ads, ads at the start and end of the podcast are ok. In the middle would just ruin the flow.
Keep up the good work, the podcast makes my Tuesday evening walk home from work!

Hello Mike, your podcast is simply the best on the net, as far as I can tell. I see no reason why you should not get some remuneration from it.
However, maybe instead of putting any more than simply "History of Rome sponsored by Audible.com" into the podcasts themselves; now that you are adding maps on the website, thus encouraging people to visit on a weekly basis, you could put the adverts there, this would also catch people surfing by. Just a thought.

Where does it all end I wonder? Romulus Augustus? Or will it continue to the fall of the Byzantine Empire?
To anyone else who loves this podcast, try looking for the podcast "12 Byzantine Emperors" for another excellent podcast.

How about a deal: get ad money if you don't take any more weeks off? Just kidding. Do whatever you need to do to keep going with the podcast. The first ten episodes or so kept me happily occupied on a long road trip and I've been hooked ever since. No more weeks off though, seriously!

Mike,

Advertising can be a good thing. If it's not horribly intrusive and gives you a bit of cash for your hard work then go for it!

Personally, I wouldn't mind a minute of advertising in your podcast.  It's hard to pass up a deal like this and you shouldn't!

I support advertisements if done briefly, discreetly at the end of the podcast. It would change the personal feel of THoR in a small way but that's okay, it's the quality of the show that is important here. Your show is terrific, the right blend of solid history with a personal touch throughout.
 As an aside I happily donated to THoR, would regular ads be in addition to ongoing donations? Blake Roberts, Vancouver BC

I am happy with you adding an advert for Audible in.  I would prefer it without but don't see why you shouldn't reap some benefit as long as there is a time limit on the advert length.  A maximum of 30 seconds, perhaps.  As others have mentioned, Dan Carlin does something similar and I am happy with it.

I listen to Leo Laporte's Twit.tv network of podcasts. The ads for him started out ok, then they go to be really obtrusive and long.
I would say for a 20 odd minute (i dont mean an odd 20 minutes, a joke). I think an audible ad would be great.
I love the podcast and i have listened to them all.

Salve Mike, it's your podcast, so do as you wish. Obviously the majority here votes in favor of ads if they are decently placed and integrated well, aand I have nothing against it.
Your podcast is my favourite ever since I stumbled across it, a wealth of knowledge, wisdom and humour. So why shouldn't you earn some of the wealth moneywise that you spread out in these other aspects so freely and generously.

Pretty much EVERYONE in podcasting is reading audible.com's ad copy (Leo Laport - I"m looking at you!) so why not?

I would prefer that you read it at either the beginning or the end so it doesn't break up the monologue - but I think the advertizers are catching onto that trick...

Just don't go overboard like the aforementioned Leo tends to do.  Read the copy - recomend a nice audio book or three and move on.

I agree with most of the folks here who say that some sort of subtle advertising at the beginning and/or end of the podcast, especially for an outfit like Audible is acceptable.

That said I don't think your stated goal of making a living at it is realistic, but I do recognize that there are expenses involved in doing a podcast and anything to help underwrite them makes sense.

I'm glad that Audible has approached you with this offer.  THoR is one of the highlights of my week, and I'd gladly listen to an Audible sponsorship.  You might get a good revenue stream from it, too, since there's a good deal of classical history on their site.  I had passed by Anthony Everitt's biography of Augustus on their site for a year or so now, but never thought to buy it till the past few weeks, as you cover the material.  Now it's in my shopping cart.

I appreciate that you gave a chance for our input. Just try and make the add as brief and to the point as possible, though you definitely have my vote. If you can get paid a little for doing something you love, go for it. Thanks,

I think taking on sponsors will help the podcast too. It will give structure to the introducion. Instead of saying "Hello and welcome to the history of Rome" and then plunging right in, you would say "Hello and welcome to the History of Rome by Mike Duncan, sponsored by Audible.com"... and then a smooth transition to the rest of the podcast.

Hi Mike, you've a fantastic product here.  To catch up, I have listened to the entire series over the last couple of weeks and am blown away by the level of interest you bring to the subject - I can't stop listening!

I can't imagine the amount of work that goes into each episode, you deserve the spoils.

Have you considered selling your podcast episodes instead of inserting advertising?  I would gladly pay.  Ricky Gervais moved to a similar model after his first 12 podcasts were successful.  You could begin to charge a small fee for the earlier episodes that you produced, whilst keeping the newest ones free to get people hooked.

On one hand, I love the way your podcast is adless, and it really gives it a feel of relaxation rather than modular information, not to mention sets it apart from others...

On the other hand, the idea of ads is not so revolting if I consider that they are paying you well earned money for it. I'll have to remind myself of that constantly though...

So if you do it, just be sure to not give them an inch of your rights, and gut them for every cent they've got. :)

Love the show!

Honestly, I think it is a good idea to allow the advertisements. Keep it to an agreeable amount it can only enhance the show in the fact it should allow for you to spend more time doing it (or maybe that is just wishful thinking).

I have no problem with a little advertising. Unless the the advertising is something like, "TRY ULTRAMAX... THE ULTIMATE ENERGY DRINK! ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH FOR THIS!" My experience with podcast advertisements lead me to believe this wouldn't be the case. Also... I listen on an iPod, so I can easily bypass those parts. But don't tell the sponsors that.

I also like the idea of you gettin' some green for something I get so much enjoyment from (I've even donated in the past due to this). You deserve a piece of the pie. And I love that you asked for input on this decision.

So, in short: As long as we don't get Julius Caesar, after a filling breakfast at Denny's, crossing the Rubicon in his Coca-Cola armor... I think we'll be alright.

Dear Mike,

It was a relief that this has come up as I can now feel secure that this wonderful podcast can continue without becoming a drain on the time and good will of those around you in the future and as a consequence you need to stop or be less regular.

I also agree with other writers on the audible spots - Dan Carlin does it well, Slate is getting better - they make it a bit like a book club discussion but 'better' is not 'good'.

The devil is in the detail of whatever deal you do. If you are comfortable with what they ask and want from you, why not?

Appreciate being asked and my best advise would be to seek advice from a good lawyer within the intellectual property field. You deserve to be paid for your work but you should also keep control of it.

Hey Mike, I think your Comitia Centuriata has weighed in with a near unanimous decision.  With few exceptions, we're all on board either way you decide.  Also, no worries, taking advertising money by no means makes us "pigs".  There's absolutley nothing wrong with applying a shrewd, above board finacial acumen to the world of podcasting.

I enjoyed THoR for a long time now, and actually suggested the Donation link a while ago. Donations would keep the MP3s clean - you could carefully 'hint' like it's done on Hardcore History (buck-a-show concept). Great podcasts should be awarded, in the best case by the listeners directly. If the donations aren't coming in then ads are probably the way to go. I'd also like to see an MP3-CD to purchase (autographed?) when this podcast ends...

Hi Mike,

I have been listening since sometime early this year and have caught up thanks to too many long haul flights in which the History of Rome has kept me sane.  I love your work and your humor, keep up the good work.  I doubt if I am alone in listening to other pod casts that are sponsored by audible and for the most part the ads hit me like water of a ducks back.  Go for it, at the very least it will help pay for your wedding which I am assuming is in the plans (re references to the soon to be Mrs History of Rome) and who knows where it will from there.

Keep up the good work and thank you for making something that I and reading these comments so many other truly enjoy.

Justin, Sydney, Aust.

And, let's face it, I haven't had the money to send in support, so do it for me, so I can stop feeling like a freeloader.  Just make sure that you have no problems with the sponsor, so you don't feel 'icky' about reading the ad each show.

I'll chime in with all those who say - "Go for it!" on the advertising.  Your podcast is so excellent, I have no problem at all with you earning something from it.  I think it's a fabulous thing.

It looks like Audible knows quality when they see it.  Way to go!

Just wanted to add my comments to the above. Love the podcast which I came upon by accident thanks to a search on Itunes Store. Definitely the best history podcast I have ever come across (definitely the best in other categories too). Go for the ads. With the amount of work you put into this, it's only right that you should get the compensation too.
All the best

hey mike, the pantheon apology made me laugh, 'an ugly business' lol. max plank invented quantum mechanics by making a mistake in his maths. serendipity. go for it on the sponsorship front. a short ad at the start would in no way detract from your most excellent podcast. and if a bit of cash could encourage you to extend your planned end from romulus augustus to say, constantine XI so much the better!

Add mine to the list of people who is just fine with an audible.com ad.  Those ads are tasteful and non-intrusive.  Anything that helps you produce these superb podcasts is for the better.

Yours is, in my opinion, the top independent podcast out there.

Dear Mike,
I've been following THoR from the very start but this is the first time I've felt obliged to offer my opinion.
Personally I'm not mad about the idea of advertising but hey what do you expect from a young naive Irish socialist?! :D
But if it doesn't interrupt the narrative and helps you create more of these little audible gems by all means go ahead with it.
Iacio intereo!
By the way, any plans to continue on into Byzantium (or Rome 2.0 as I like to think of it) after 476?

Hello,

I've been a listener for awhile, and enjoy your podcast. As far as I am concerned, ads are not a negative thing. If you are in a position to reap some funds for your program I would go for it. I can only image the time and effort that goes into your show, and you should not feel bad about receiving revenue for it.

I recently started placing ads on my blog after holding off for awhile. The donations were not exactly pouring in.

Good luck, and keep up the amazing work on your great podcast.

Mitch

Hey Mike,

I usually have around 400 or so podcasts downloaded at any time (I travel a lot) and I have to say, yours is among only 2 on the whole of the internet I wait for every week - and the first I will listen to after I get a chance to sync.  Keep up the good work!

As for the money, I agree with nearly all the other posts here, do it, just don't interrupt your wonderful episodes for it.

I say take the money and either buy control control of a Mediterranean empire or keep the podcast going forever.

(I prefer the second choice (and woe to those who can only see to the end of the Byzantine empire - I say keep going right up to the present day (whoever you follow, I shall follow)))!

We can trace the decline of the "history of rome podcast" to when it shifted from being the work of a freeman to that of a man more loyal his advertising "general" than the lofty ideal of the podcasting republic

Just kidding,I am soooooooooooo appreciative of your work, it would be the height of arrogance to begrudge you a few bucks in advertising revenue.

Mike,
I've been a longtime listener and I must say that your podcast is the most comprehensive, most even keeled, highest quality historical podcast I have yet heard.  When you requested feedback on the possibility of advertisements, I felt that after receiving such an outstanding podcast for so long, I owed you my typed out support for this advertisement business.  It will bother me not at all to listen to exhortations to purchase something; you certainly deserve compensation for the fine podcast you produce.  I would also like to add that I, as some of my fellow listeners have said, would love to see you carry The History of Rome all the way down to the fall of the second Rome, Constantinople, but should you only finish with your stated goal of Romulus Augustulus, it will be a great service to myself and many others.  Thank you for what you do.

Hi Mike,

I listen to Dan Carlin and he includes advertisements for Audible as well as requests to donate to the show.

Like the previous commenter, I don't think there's anything wrong with that if it helps you devote more time to the podcast.  I love the idea recommending a good book to purchase on audible.com on the period of Rome you're covering.

Hi Mike, Ads should be fine, if it helps you to get more episodes on the air on more topics. I am sure you will ensure that the ads will not impinge on the content and will not have a very obtrusive presence.

An ad or two won't bother this fan. By the way, I have been "saving up" a few episodes to listen to during a half-marathon I'm running here in Sydney next week. It's the only thing that keeps me going - music just doesn't do it for me I'm afraid. Your podcast is an absolute gem - I can't bear the thought that it might end with the demise of the Western empire ...any chance we could convince you to go Byzantine thereafter?

Mike,

Essentially it comes down to this: it would be incredibly selfish of us to say that you should not do this.

If having ads (a) earns you some money and allows you to potentially pursue this field in a full-time capacity if you want to, and (b) ensures there are no further hiatuses, then it's win-win for both you and your fans.

But as others have said, make sure you get yourself a good deal - you deserve it.

Cheers,
Nick

I have been listening faithfully to the podcast for almost a year now and regard it as essential to breaking the monotony of my long monday morning metro ride into work. I would be loath to begrudge you the chance to take a wage from such a well crafted  podcast, but at the same time I am a trifle uneasy as to the possibility that the format and quality of THoR should be altered.
All in all I would say go for it but please be careful not to dilute the quality and alienate your faithful audience.

Audible by all means.I see that Hardcore History has been mentioned, but do listen to the Slate Political Gabfest for a different take on how the endorsement can be presented. You've taken some care in how you structure your story, don't let the advert stand out in a jarring manner. I'm glad you continued producing this history and I'll be even happier if you pick up some pennies for doing it.

I just listened to episode 53, in which you pondered advertising on your show.

You present your audience with a professional, thoughtful, well made lecture series, on a subject we enjoy.  You deserve to be paid professionally for your professionalism.

If the ads do become intrusive or otherwise bothersome, you sound like the type with decent enough judgment to decide what to do, when the time comes.

Go for it.  And if you decide to go all-out pro, with lecture series on other subjects, then I will be among the first to listen and to reward your sponsors, because of your apparent intelligence.

Go ahead, make a living.

Hey Mike,

I have been enjoying these podcasts far above some of the other shows I listen to. I have listened to other podshows that use audible as a sponsor, and it seems to fit into the show alot better than some other ads. I wouldn't mind if the ads were at the beginning or at the end. I listen to one podshow where they are intersperced throughout the show and it gets tedious.

Even if it didn't make a profit for you, I would imagine it would defray some of the costs, and that is always a plus. I was a little against the idea of commercials at first, but then I put myself in your position, who am I to demand purity, I am not paying for this show. So I say go for it. What would Octavian do? Then I fully expect you to have conquered Audible inside a month :)

As a plug, I tell my friends and family about this show, THOR and a few others are what make this new medium so worthwhile. Keep it going strong.

Mike - I’ve been listening since 753 and at the time, I must say that it was a little difficult for me to imagine progressing all the way through Augustus.  But you are still going strong and you are to be commended for your dedication.  I’ve listened to several academic courses offered through iTunes U and I must say that I find yours as enjoyable & informative as the very best of them.

I have never posted a comment before, and at the risk of being repetitive, a couple of thoughts:
1) thanks for asking our opinion and including the rest of us in your decision making process.
2) in my opinion, you should definitely do the advertising.  You do a great job, and you deserve to be compensated for your efforts.  Keep up the great work.

Thanks again...and as always, you have me looking forward to Monday.

I have no problem with advertising on your podcast.  Audible sponsors several other podcasts that I listen too and the ads are not intrusive at all.  In fact TWIT with Leo Laporte has a book recommendation each week as part of the audible ad.  You could do something similar to suggest some of your source material or books you would recommend on other subjects that they have available.

Love the podcast.

As it relates to advertisement, my preference would be for you to continue with your current format, however the commercial realizations are what they are, and I have no problem with you to include advertisement, especially something like Audible, which I am a member and enjoy their service.

Hi Mike,
I totally agree with the overwhelming majority of comments so far.  I think you are doing an amazing job with THOR - easily the best podcast out there.  Thanks for inviting feedback on this issue of potential advertising - hopefully you can see from the comments that there is a huge amount of respect, affection and trust out there for you, as well as an appreciation of the amount of effort that must go in to producing something of the consistent quality of THOR (I dont know how you do it frankly).  If you can make a few bob whilst continuing to entertain and educate, and if it helps ensure THOR continues, then absolutely go for it.
One thing though, a couple of times you have needed to miss a week or so - vacation, house move etc - please make sure in whatever agreement you reach with Audible that you still have the freedom to do this. No point earning a few quid if you dont get the chance to spend it.  Very best wishes to you and Mrs THOR, and thanks again for your wonderful contribution to the world.

Get an ironclad contract and don't let them bully you.  Make sure all issues of content control, frequency of updates, placement of ads, and duration of ads are settled to your satisfaction up front.  Also the terms of withdrawal - who gets rights to what if they drive you to quit.  You are in complete control of this exchange - don't sign anything away.  Don't give them any loopholes that they can later close and strangle your fun.

Then, and only then, accept the offer.  It's not worth it otherwise.  THOR is your baby.

Mike, I listen to several podcast and all are financed in some way by ads (many of them Audible in fact). I see no problem whatsoever with you speaking a while about Audible. Just look at the fantastic TWiT, Net@Night and Diggnation podcast for example.

Hey Mike --

The way I look at it, if you don't get paid something you'll be under-incentivized for such an amazing podcast. Every Sunday afternoon my son and I start checking iTunes for the latest episode; I haven't looked forward to something every week as much since Johny Quest went off the air. Keep up the awesome work, and thanks!

Hi Mike,
Thank you for such a great job correcting the Pantheon information!!!  If you have never visited this building, it is truly a remarkable space.  For the past 15+ years, I have had the pleasure of teaching a 2-week university course in Rome focusing on the history of its art and architecture.  Visiting the Pantheon is one of the true highlights of the trip.  One year, in fact, I managed to get into it just as the doors opened and there was no body else in the building...it is an experience I will never forget.

For anyone who has never been to Rome or the Pantheon it should be on the "Bucket list."

Oh, and as for the ads--for what it is worth, I agree with the prevailing vote YES!  You do such a great job and I know how much work these take--you should definitely reap some reward for your labor!

I'm still trying to get my head round the fact you're doing all this for free in the first place.  Doubt many people would like them but dare say they'd have to be pretty intrusive before they put anybody off listening.

course if they're actually for something interesting (shouldn't be too hard with audible), would probably welcome them - particularly if you can keep some sort of 'editorial independence' (hey we trust you)

As a faithful listener to your podcast I fully support anything that makes producing the podcast more rewarding for you. A few seconds of commercials are a small price to pay for your detailed, humorous delivery. I cherish the hope that you will continue this podcast up to the Byzantine and beyond (a History of Carthage perhaps?), so please, make it worthwhile for yourself.
on another topic, I'd love to know more about your source material, and while I can see the value of keeping the podcast light, it would be great to get an occasional reference. Just for curiosity sake.

I just watched Terry Jones's Barbarian's part four of four. It was about Attila the Hun and revealed information about the warlord that I wasn't tought in school. Beware once you enter that part of the history of Rome. ;)

Looking forward to the next episode, as always.

Hi Mike - the choice is yours, as only you know how comfortable you feel with the Audible offer and what they ask of you - however if it's any reassurance, another podcast I follow closely has an Audible deal in place, and it hasn't affected my enjoyment of their podcast (it's mention of Audible at the begining and end is low key and reasonable) nor the quality.

Hello,

What you are doing is truly incredible. Every week you sit down and deliver an interesting, complex and humourous analysis of an important part of world history. FOR NO MONEY. That you have done this demonstrates your intellectual integrity and your commitment to spreading knowledge. As long as they aren't allowed any control over the content of your podcasts you deserve to make some money. Hell buy yourself some more computer equipment, buy Mrs History of Rome a present or a great night out for you spending all this time on podcasting. In short you have already demonstrated your integrity, allow yourself to be rewarded for your good deeds.

Cheers from London

I think it is clear that most people support the ads.  I certainly do.  This is one of my favorite podcasts (the day that itunes automatically and unexpectedly downloaded your newest episode after I thought the podcast was gone for good was a GREAT day!) and the quality certainly warrants paid ads.  Further, I found it very touching that you would ask your listeners for input, and that you put the quality of the content before monetary considerations.    I suggest that you get other sponsors too.  Short little podcast ads are not very intrusive (especially compared to radio and TV), and most mp3 players can easily skip ahead for those people who desperatley need to get directly to the History of Rome.  Keep up the great work.

I have been listening to your podcast from day one, and considering the obvious amount of work you put into each episode, it would be criminal for you NOT to take advantage of some kind of compensation!  This is one of the stronger historical podcasts out there, and is certainly worthy of being sponsored.

That being said... if you are going to become "commercial" in that sense... then I would advise you to consult with an expert on proper Latin pronounciation. Your way of pronouncing Antony ("ant-knee") and plebian (before you corrected it back in the day) was more than a little jarring, and Marcellus is said with a soft C, not a hard C. Being a Roman history junkie who's listened to dozens of audiobooks and seen "I, Claudius" a dozen or more times, it can be very distracting for me.  You're doing quality research; your pronounciation should help reflect that.

Even if it just means listening to Colleen McCullough's Rome series on audiobook... that would help polish your Latin vocab!

Keep up the good work - I'll keep listening, regardless!

I actually WANT you to run ads.  I love this podcast, and I would love to see it become so profitable for you that you would be able to make podcasting your primary source of income.  Maybe if it was your primary source of income, you could do a few more episodes per week, or launch another podcast (The Imperial Presidency) or two.

Don't fear capitalism.  You are creating value.  There is nothing wrong with you receiving value in return.

As long as I don't have to go to audible to hear your podcast, if you want to spend a minute talking about an advertiser then you should probably do it, especially since it will encourage to do the episodes and give you a bit more motivation to see the history of Rome to its conclusion.

absolutely amazing podcast by the way.  got into it at episode 5 a long time ago.  I know you took a long break last summer.  maybe getting some money from adds will get you to keep it going all year long?

Just don't want to have to pay for it from audible

Anything you need to do to keep this story going is ok by me, including brief advertising. Some other suggestions:
1. Let people know they can support your efforts directly through contributions via your THoR web site;
2. Put an address on the website to send checks to. I for one will send a check, but have hesitated to donate so far from fear of using a credit card on the internet;
3. If you do use audible.com, put your own stuff up there. Then only give away the most recent (10 or so) episodes. This is the HBO model (e.g. Soprannos, The Wire, ROME!!  etc.) and they make a lot of dough off of their old shows. And let's not forget that your stuff will never ever get old.

Best of Luck Mike, and keep up the good work (don't forget the PO box for donor checks)

Hey Mike,

First up thanks for all your hard work on all these podcasts so far. You break one of the most intertesting times in History into nice bitesize chunks and you do so without a bias typical of modern day media and with a little pinch of dry humour which is always a bonus.

You mentioned that you're planning to go back and add maps to old podcasts. Well not that I want to add to you work load but a the sound on a couple of the podcasts was faulty. I can't remember the humbers but it might be worth re-recording those just to have everything fixed up.

With regards to adding adverts/sponsorship to your podcasts, I'm really not a fan. For a start I'm from the UK so I doubt whatever you're promoting will have any relevance to me. Also I'm keeping these on file for future listening and to have adverts in them will take away the timelessness of them. But that said I understand you see a commercial oppurtunity here and you deserve to reap some reward for all you hard work. I'll still be listening regardless. I just hope they don't interfere too much. Put them at the end so I can skip to the next episode at that point. Haha.

Dear Mike,
Thank you for the countless hours of entertainment/enlightenment. If advertising will allow you to spend even more time on THoR, and the installments will be longer and/or more frequent, please do succumb to the almighty buck.If advertising is to pad the existing length/frequency, I'll be annoyed at Audible; frankly, if possible, I avoid products with huge ad budgets or piss-off factors....
Your podcasts are wonderful, and the highlight of my week.
If advertising intrudes without a "pay-off", i.e. more THoR, I'll avoid the bastards like the plague, but not you, you wonderful man.

Mike - the quality of your podcasts is head and shoulders above most professional broadcast work.   The only history podcast I know of that is of similar quality is the 12 Byzantine Rulers series - which I assume you've listened to many times.

Get thee an agreement with Audible and while you're at it explore any other commercial possiblities.  Given the number of fans you have I think its quite logical to assume you have an inbuilt market that would check out whatever you did next.

I dont believe many people just listen to the occasional podcast of yours.   From what I see, people discover it and commit.   And thats a sign from the gods that you deserve to be paid !

Brilliant show, thanks for all your effort putting it together, a true highlight of my week.
In some ways it would be a shame to include adverts. One of the many beauties of this podcast is its generosity of spirit, the feeling you are doing this to for no other reason than to share your knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject. However just reading that back sounds ridiculously pompous and a man cannot live on praise alone. If it means you can keep on producing the show as well as worrying less about funding it then sod it, take the cash. Just make sure they don't start trying to contract you into specific deadlines, if you can't have a few weeks off now and then what's the point?

Hi Mike!

I've just caught up to the present on the Podcast, and its among my favorites. Thanks for the work you put into it.

I'm not a huge fan of ads for this particular Podcast. I think the episodes are very much of one piece now, with the unobtrusive but effective musical intro and outro, and no delay in getting to the goods. Audible ads are not to bad, but I think they would harm the artistic integrity quite a bit. I'd still listen, and I'd still appreciate the Podcast even with ads, though.

I think some advertising is not only tolerable, I think it's a good thing, and I'm wholeheartedly in favor of it.  In the long run, that's what keeps great things like the History of Rome going.  A person needs some reward (beyond just a warm and fuzzy feeling inside).  As long as it is kept in its place and doesn't adversely affect the quality of the material, I think it's a good thing.

This  podcast is one of the highlights of my week.  You clearly put a ton of work into it and if you can make some cheddar (not the Tillamook kind but enough to by some of the Tillamook kind and perhaps even some crackers) go for it!  You are offering a free killer oral history of Rome.  One little ad at the beginning or end won't bother me at all and I would feel better knowing you got some spending change.  I am flat ass broke most days since I got laid off and I sure as heck don't want you to be.

Do it, Mike! If Dan Carlin is willing to risk his finicky fan-base on Audible ad revenues, you're well in the right to as well. Thanks for such an entertaining podcast.

I agree that 1-3 ads at the beginning of your podcast and one at the end would not be at all objectionable.  You deserve to monetize this hobby if for nothing else than to defray your costs.  Personally, I find ad copy read by the host to be more agreeable than prerecorded segments.

Even if someone says that they would stop listening in protest of advertisement, I doubt that they would actually follow through, as hypocrisy can not be determined.

Mike, you are doing my very favourite podcast and anything that keeps you on the air is fine by me.  Quite a few other podcasts that I listen to are sponsored by Audible - some manage the advertising of Audible significantly more subtle than others (compare Hardcore History with Slate's Political Gabfest).  Keep up the good work.

I have to drop a line to say without doubt this is at present the best pod cast to while away those long hours in traffic to and from work. It riveting and read exceptionally well. I look forward to listening to the end of this great empire. And once over, looking forward to what will the next long running history epic. I actually sometimes end up sitting in my garage until the episode I am listening to ends, not wanting to stop half way through.
Keep up the good work, excellent all the way.

Well Mike considering it's your show and we plebs are living at your whims I'd say having the loyalty of the troops is just nice.
My favourite comments are the ones that refer to the show.  We do hail you Augustus!
The ads are absolutley fine.  My comment is tv is run on the ads.  It was soap that paid for all the best in US entertainment first radio then tv.
As well I like your audible ads.  You recommend reading material I'm interested in therefore, I listen to the ads.  Once I get used to the idea of using a credit card on-line, well then I will here and there.
It would be a good idea for you to have a PO Box though for cheques.  You've told the world the city you live in so, I hope it's not that you are worried about stalkers.

Another grat episode Mike!  However, I'm have a question about the untimely death of Marcellus.  I've always thought his death was attributed to the hand of Livia, at least so said the Roman gossip circles.  Is there any historical evidence to support this?  I also recently watched the 1970's BBC production "I, Claudius" which would lead one to believe that Livia had a hand in many deaths in the Julio-Claudian family tree.  While I'm sure their dramatic license was in use, how far off base are these kind of implications of murder by Livia?  Oh yeah, I also love the maps.

Mike,
Love your podcast! And have recommended it to several friend.  I listen to you during my commute, but today I nearly landed in the ditch when you started talking about the Pantheon in Rome.
! The one standing in Rome today was built by Hadrian--not Trojan. Its design is not modeled on the original one built by Agrippa, but was designed by Adrian himself.  The dedication by Agrippa is actually on the pediment

Hi Mike,

As ever a great episode. I like your balanced accounts, particularly the neutral way that you talked about Marcellus' suspicious death. The Robert Graves version is not backed up by any serious historical record save some hearsay Repeated by Dio Cassius - "Livia, now, was accused of having caused the death of Marcellus, because he had been preferred before her sons".

I would like to pick up one small pronunciation thing - Marcellus is, I believe, pronounced Marsellus - not Markellus. Keep it up Mike, it's fascinating stuff, and I would agree the Pantheon in Rome is awesome while the Colloseum - overrated.

@ Mike,

I think the consensus is that Livia was not the serial murderess her contemporary enemies made her out to be. While she did have a thing for concocting homemade potions and remedies, I plan to mostly avoid the whole Augusta-poisoned-everyone meme.

@ Samantha,

You're right, I totally faceplanted on the Pantheon. I'm sorry I almost made you drive into a ditch. I promise I'll make it up to you.

@ Allen,

The funny thing is that when I was talking about the original Marcus Claudius Marcellus (he of the Second Punic War) I got grief from Latin students for using the soft C. Oh well.

Thanks for listening. Love the feedback- it keeps me honest

Mike,

I've been listening to your podcast for a while now but never posted before so I figure now is as good a time as any. First off I love the work you have done with this. I am a classics major and I can tell you that the accuracy and clarity of your work in my mind has no rival. I wait with baited breath every Sunday in anticipation for the new episode.  Also with Latin pronunciations the Romans never did have a soft 'c' all of them were pronounced like a 'k' and whenever there is a 'ae' it is pronounced like a long 'i'. But when the names are pronounced in English most of the time the 'ae' remains a long 'i' sound, while the hard 'c' often becomes a soft 'c'. For instance to the Romans "Cicero" would be pronounced like "Kikero." Really though don't sweat it, the transliterations confuse me at times. Thank you so much for the fantastic work.

--Kurt

Thank you for the awesome podcast. Listening to this has gotten me very interested in Rome and the classical world in general, and now I'm devouring books about it!

A minor mistake in this episode I'd like to bring to your attention. You said the Pantheon was rebuilt in 126 B.C., when it is obviously 126 A.D.

One other point on the Pantheon, you said it was commisioned to be rebuilt by Trajan in 126BC after being destroyed in 80AD...... Something tells me that's not quite possible.  I'm sure you meant 126AD.  Also, I'm not sure if I missed something along the way but.... What happened to Cicero?  I know you mentioned Antony wanted him dead but has Rome's greatest orator and philosopher exited the stage so unceremoniously?  I've read accounts of his head and hands being nailed up for display in the Forum and Cassius Dio's story of Fulvia stabbing Cicero's tongue while on display.  I'm just wondering how accurate those accounts are?

I think I owe you and the blog participants a small apology for my posting above.  I was typing the posting on my BlackBerry.  Although great for using to listen to the History of Rome on, not the best for typing.  Sorry for the couple of mis-types (should be "Trajan" and not "Trojan" and "Hadrian" not "Adrian" ;)

Thanks! and looking forward to your next installment.

I assumed that since podcasts are a tech medium, that your maps would be digitally created. As a graphics person, I laughed out loud (with pleasure) at your new maps. I'm imagining you tracing the country outlines out of your encyclopedia set from 1980. They are charming, and I appreciate that you drew all those parallel lines and didn't even draw over the mountains.I hope you had a podcast as fun as the History of Rome to listen to while you labored at those maps!

I am a Computer Scientist...I do not like History, cause we programmers are always looking Forward.

But, you have made it fascinating, and you have set a bar, that now all Professors must meet, exceed or simply match.

We have traveled from 753 BC to 23 BC, some 730 years...so? Look at it this way?

Just wanted to say I love your podcast before I dove into a bit of oversensitive geekery.

I thought you might want to know that recently the role of the Pantheon as, well, a Pan-Theon or a temple of all gods has come into question. For one thing, if you've ever been there you might notice that the inside is GORGEOUS, and that the marble you see in there today matches the exact pattern (though it is from a recent discovery of a cache of ancient marble rather than the original) of the ancient "temple".

However, ancient temples were never entered by any but the clergy, thus there would have been no point in making the inside beautiful. It seems more likely that the site was a monument. To who? Well, to Romulus, by Agrippa. In the time when it was built it would have been facing Augustus' own mausoleum, not to mention its on the site on the Campus Martius where the Romans believed Romulus disappeared (apotheosis, or torn to pieces?). It was only in later years that the site lost its original meaning and was reinterpreted as a Pantheon.

Not sure if this has been confirmed yet, but its what I've gleaned from my studies. Once again, I love the show and thank you for all your hard work!

Michael,

Your way of delivering history in a way that is so "listen-able" and the amount of work you have put into your podcasts are incredible.  Roman history has fascinated my since I was 12 when I read "The Twelve Caesars."  Your podcasts have me delving once again into the many fascinating characters in Roman history.

I've listened to almost all of them in sequence and on the  bus home today I'll be listening to episode 53.

From your blogs it's apparent that you have listeners from around the world.  Your work is truly appreciated !

Hi Mike,

I just wanted to post a comment to say thanks for your incredible podcasts!

I live in Sydney, Australia and have conscientiously followed your podcasts as they chronicle the 'Fall of the Roman Republic' which is my favourite topic area of my favourite subject at school - Ancient History. I'm two days away from my High School finals and still listening to your podcasts (especially from 34 - 53!) :D

The way you both write and deliver this wonderful material has completely revolutionised the way I have learned this subject - I am now top of my class and remember many of the stories in your podcasts as close to verbatim as I can get - absolutely fascinating stuff.

Just wanted to extend my sincerest congratulations for such a wonderful enterprise - albeit from half a globe away!

Well done Mike!

Laura in Sydney

Interestingly enough, this weeks THoR episode coincides with the possible discovery of Anthony and Cleopatra's tomb after centuries!

Care to see the mask of what Anthony may have looked like?

You can read one article here:

Did I miss it or was there no mention of the fate of Caesarion? It seems like that's a fairly major event and showed Octavian's true ruthlessness.

@ Michael,

That's really exciting news (and an awesome coincidence). Thanks for the link.

@lainB,

You didn't miss anything. I'm going to cover the fate of all the kids next week when I talk about Octavian's Triumph. Two Caesars is one Caesar to many...

not trying to be debbie downer on this, but the article implies that the archaeologist who made the discovery is considered something of a hack by his peers. hopefully in this case he's proven right, but just thought it was worth mentioning.

as always, mike, great work, and especially now that you're starting to add maps. the ones for this episode are great and i think i speak for everyone in that they are very much appreciated. here's hoping you can actually find time to add ones for the back episodes. i, for one, go back and listen to old shows quite often and am often finding myself looking for a map.  thanks again for the outstanding work!

Fantastic!  The maps are a great addition.  What's after Rome anyway?  The History of Greece?  The History of Egypt?

I would so look forward to the Exodus podcast!

...not trying to get ahead as you have a lot more to go, but when will Rome end - after the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in the 5th Century or will you include Byzantium up to the 1490's?

Regards the discovery of Cleo and Mark you posted, and one comment above:  Zahi Hawass is what is called a "Political Scientist".  He is the researcher of record on just about any dig current in Egypt in that he is the official one must apply through. Not to denigrate Dr  Hawass' skills, it is just the way things are done there.

There is no better podcast for simple quality of delivery, lack of bombast or over-talk, confidence and good humor. Now that I've powered through all the older episoes, I await each update like a kid waiting on Christmas. Thanks HUGELY for this series!

You helped make sense of Livy’s early history of Rome for me; you made it come alive with your good humor and your ability to cut through the minutiae.  I hope you see this thing through the fall of Byzantium.

As long as everyone is making suggestions for the three-years-in-the-future podcasts, I would like to suggest the Russian Empire.  It has nearly the same history of excess, scandal and political infighting as the Romans.

CONGRATULATIONS on a successful production.

I have only recently come to podcasting but have almost become addicted to listening for the next installment. Luckily as I am late I can cram 3-5 episodes in per day.

I see there are regular comments about your pronunciation of some words/names, but I feel this is not very fair as we all learn our pronunciation from English actors in old movies (The Americans always being the enslaved heroes battling the overlords). As a Scotsman I say keep true to your own feelings - we will cope, I am sure any true Latin speakers would scoff at the English.

Great insight on Octavian's lifeview when faced with Alexander. Who was the greatest of them all?

Keep up the good work, I'm catching up quickly.

Please Mike, the way you say "Ant-ny" is driving me crazy. It's An-to-ny, three syllables.

I can hardly stand to listen to any of the podcasts dealing with Antony because of the way you say the name.

Other than that I enjoy your work.

Just wanted to say I look forward to this podcast posting more than any other. Also, regarding HBO Rome series, the tragic thing about the second season was that they knew they were going to be cancelled early on, so they rushed through or slightly changed events to give the series some sort of ending. Additionally, I believe they went for cultural authenticity first, and historical accuracy second. Only the good die young.

Mike,
You've done an excellent job yet again at portray the real men behind the history of Rome. I was a little disappointed that you made no mention of Salvidienus Rufus involvement in Octavian's rise to power and then his later treachery, although he was a relatively minor figure compare to Agrippa. I am a little curious if you will dive more into the the relationship between Octavian/Augustus and Agrippa. I'm also interested in the Private life and personality of Octavian/Augustus, what was he like as a man?
Great work I look forward to next weeks episode.

Speaking of Rufus, where is Gaius Maecenas? Octavian was the hand, Maecenas was the velvet glove, and Agrippa was the brass knuckles. They were a team and the two other men were the only reason why Octavian got as far as he did. Just saying.

I made one podcast years ago - it was meant to be a humorous alternative guide to a more seedy part of London. It took me ages and loads of work. I never got past the first episode so I appreciate the work involved in this effort. Can't thank you enough, have a good break but please come back.

Mike,

Many, many thanks. I'm totally addicted to your podcasts. I'm an amateur historian, a history major in college, and have been reading Roman history for years. But I never had the whole story from start to finish. Too often I'd be reading about the transition from Republic to Empire, my real interest, (whether in primary or secondary sources) but I never had the historical background of the Republic I'd need really to understand the transition.  You are doing it, providing me with many retroactive 'aha' moments, and you are doing it with wit and flair. Bravo!

I've only just started, so I'm at episode 11 or so. So far I have one suggestion. I wish you would devote a little more attention to the sources you are using. You do mention Livy, true. But who else? What are his strengths and weaknesses? What about secondary sources? I liked 12 Byzantine Rulers, too, but this was also Lars's weakness, and it seems to me so far you are paying a little less attention to sources than did he.

But that relatively minor quibble aside, I'm very grateful for your work!

I want to thank you for your effort in creating what is (IMHO) the best podcast series I've ever listened to. I started downloading them about 6 months ago and have recently finished listening to the entire series (It took 3 days).
I want to thank the author for three reasons.

1. Your willingness to take all the available historical accounts with a grain of salt. No other historical commentator shows as much freedom of interpretation as you do and in doing so you have set a wonderful example for us all.

2. Your willingness to explore the entire history and not just the over advertised parts (ie. 2nd carthaginian war, Julius Caesar and the split of the empire) Thanks for all the other parts.

3. The humor you show in commenting on the opinions of ancient characters and the only too human reactions they make when cornered, challenged or otherwise threatened. By holding these people up on a pedastal some history teachers make out that they were not like normal men, when they so obviously were. While these events have been recited to me by old men with dusty chalkboards and even dustier books your humorous comments on the stupidity of some of these historical charachters is as welcome as a fresh breeze in those dusty classrooms.

Thank you for these podcasts they are now the best part of my week and I thankyou for all your effort.
Keep up the good work

Kris Syme

Mike-first, absolutely love the podcast. I discovered it right before the long hiatus last year and was overjoyed when you came back.  I was wondering if you were going to give any mention to the HBO series Rome (I apologize if you've already answered this in another post, I haven't read all of them)?  Back in the Spartacus episode you gave a few shoutouts to the movie, and from what I've gathered the movie took a few liberties with the historical fact.  However, the HBO series, of which material you are currently covering, seems to be remarkably accurate historically-speaking, at least for a Hollywood production.  Of course some things are fudged here and there, but they seem to have gotten it right more often than not, and I was wondering your thoughts on it.  I actually just watched the episode last night from season two when Antony and Octavian patch things up.

And for what it's worth, I don't know why, but referring to your fiancee as The Future Mrs. History of Rome is absolutely hilarious to me.

Keep up the good work.  My Monday-morning train rides to work are considerably easier with your podcasts downloaded on my IPod to cheer me up.

I really had no idea that Octavian's involvement at this juncture was as peripheral as it was.  That's a very interesting point.  I also wonder how the Roman public reacted to these somewhat arbitrary-seeming proscriptions.  I would have thought they would react negatively and maybe done something, but maybe they were just too tired and scared after so many years of civil war.

Hey Mike.

Like the others I want to thank you for an excellent podcast. Your dry humor and attention to the facts that matter make your commentaries truly enlightening. I discovered it last July on a forum and I've listened to every episode since. Again thanks! Wish you the best from up here in Canada

@ David,

I liked most of the first season of Rome (Ciarán Hinds was a great Caesar), but I will confess that I haven't watched the second season. In all, I thought the history tracked pretty well, but some of the subplots drove me nuts (could there be a more thoroughly unlikeable man than Lucius Vorenus?). I hear that Brutus and Cassius are shown dying in battle though, rather than committing suicide, but I suppose that can be forgiven.

@John

It is interesting that the junior member of both Triumvirates came out on top. Something to watch out for, I suppose.

re: proscriptions, I think the 100,000 troops the Triumvirs commanded stifled most dissent. No one liked it, but what could they do?

@Robert

That's a great idea. I'm pretty sure the whole carrying-your-wife-over-the-threshold thing got started in Rome because it was bad hoodoo for a wife to trip on her first step into a new home.

(The Date is September 23 by the way. No one will ever believe me, but she picked it out.)

Mike,

Your podcast is fabulous.

It seems to me that there must have been many a military wife widowed at all social levels throughout the history of Rome.  Did they continue with the family business and what happened to the women whose husband's job was the military?  Was plural marriage institutionalized?  What role did women slaves play in this fabric?  This may be obvious to most of your listeners but I am a neophyte to Roman history.

Mike, I highly recommend the second season.  The series is what made me fall back in love with Roman history to begin with (hadn't read or studied anything about it since high school).  Season 2 does lack a little focus at the beginning because you don't have such an influential character like Caesar around (agreed about Ciaran Hinds) and I didn't think they did a good enough job addressing the power vacuum after his death, but once Brutus/Cassius get their act together in the East and Octavian grows up and patches things up with Antony, it really picks up steam.  And the stuff between Antony and Cleopatra, I thought they nailed it.  You heard right about Brutus/Cassius' deaths, Brutus' being particularly brutal, but that's all I'll mention.  Thanks again for a great podcast.

OMG they're all falling on their swords for their honor it's just like a Shakespeare play!!!

Does anyone else feel that sometimes the volume is just a tad low?  My ipod quit and I got a cheaper player and I have to turn the volume all the way up on this podcast and it makes my pillow speaker clip. (or whatever the words is)  (It cuts out whe the volume is all the way up)   I fault the pillow speaker mostly,  but does anyone else have to turn the volume all the way up particularly when Mike gets that elegaic tone?

Mike - Your work here is definitely the best podcast I have ever encountered. Having majored in Greek and Roman studies I had expected to just receive a sort of refresher as I listened. But I have yet to listen to an episode in which I have not learned something new about people I spent years reading about. I have also never been able to chronologically order the events you have covered in my mind so easily. Thank you for reviving my passion for Roman history.

Ode to Mike Duncan from a happy excerciser

Atop machines of excercise and sweat
I listen to my iPod to endure it
I sought a podcast interesting and great
And lo: I found a way I could procure it

I thank you, Mike, I cherish and salute you
For all your work with Roman chronicling
I hope my praise and gratitude will soothe you
(and else: I sent some twenty dollars in)

Kind regards,

I too wish to thank you for a very addictive podcast. I listen to it every day walking to and from school. It's like audio crack, and I start going into withdrawl if I don't listen to at least one episode per day.

Re:Rome (HBO series)
When watching the final half of the second season, keep in mind that the events you watch were originally going to be spread over two or three seasons. They found out half way through the second season that they would be canceled and decided to incorporate as much as they could. I read the original plan was for the 3rd or 4th season to end with a certain carpenter being born.

I also read HBO is considering bringing it back in some fashion which I hope is true (though it was the most expensive series HBO ever produced).

I like podcasts that vary, i.e. Hardcore History, but it's nice to have a few that really go into one subject- in that area, the only contenders are Napoleon 101 and this one.

Mr. Duncan,

Thanks for the great podcast series.  I've spent the past month or so catching up to real time with your series and it has been a pleasure.  I look forward to many more quality episodes...

For those who like this podcast, I would suggest the Napoleon 101 podcast from The Podcast Network.

Dear Mike,
I would like to thank you for this podcast, which is, without a doubt, the single best podcast I have yet to come across. The humanity with which you imbue the far past renders history an art form.

I discovered your history six days ago, and in those six days have listened to every installment. Upon learning all that I have from your generous work, I have a request--one that I will fully understand you not granting; could you, so as to not distrupt my current listening habits, produce your podcast, rather than once a week, ten times a day?

Thank you for your time, your work, and the gift you have given all of us,
-Jesse Quebbeman-Turley

Oh ya, I forgot to ask.

By the time of the second Triumvirate, were the legions still made up of Cohorts, as per the Marian reforms? On a later episode I thought I heard you say Maniple when talking about the legions.

Thanks,

These are so incredible.

I am so impressed with how Mike can keep all the info together. This is a huge amount of material and for those of us who read this stuff a lot, I can assure you that it is no easy task to keep it all together AND THEN to present in a form that is fun and still retaining all the brilliant matter.

A few years late, but I just found your podcast a month ago when I began my 50 mile journey too and from work each day.  Awesome podcast... I tell all my coworkers and friend about it.  I listen to the History of Rome too and from work every day... it actually helps me get out of bed at 5:15am.  Thank you for doing this...

When I Googled triumvirate, the other one was in China.  Have you thought about doing the history of China?

Another great episode Mike!  By far the best podcast series I have ever heard!  I have always found the story of Octavian a particularly fascinating one.  How a boy that seemed so frail could grasp the reigns of power in such a turbulant time and in a society dominated by the honorable warrior mind frame like Rome no less.  But as you said, it was really Agrippa doing all the heavy lifting.  I have always pictured the relationship between Octavian and Agrippa as one resembling The Emperor Palpatine and Vader.  A relationship where one expressed their will and the other executed it.  Keep up the good work Mike!

Mike your awesome! Im only 17 but ive been obsessed with Rome and especially Caesar for about 10 years..and this is the best stuff ive ever gotten my hands on.

Just one question though..you mentioned Servilia, Brutus' mother briefly in one of the previous episodes but i was under the impression that she was a major factor in why Brutus betrayed Caesar. Correct me if im wrong but i thought that he was not happy with his mother being Caesar's mistress and so was already a bit annoyed with him. As i said..im happy to be corrected if i'm wrong..after all, our aim is to learn more about history :)

Top stuff mate..but i am a bit dissappointed i dont get to hear a new episode this week..but its damn good of you to use your free time helping us all learn more about a topic that has interested so many of us for so long. Have fun on your week off :)

By the way guys..anyone else interested in Julius Caesar should read Conn Iggulden's "Emperor" series. They are works of fiction but are an extremely captivating read and at the end of each of the 4 books are a few pages of notes on what he added into the story and what really happened.

In case you are wondering if anyone still listens to podcasts posted more than three years be assured...we do!  I've been playing these for my 9 and 7 year-old at night for the past few months.  We just listened to Episode 47 last night.

I realized that, through THOR, my children are getting what was once considered a required element of education for any upper class family...The History of Rome!  Without even knowing it, you have a place in our family as our History Tutor (a la 17th century Europe). Thanks for making us feel like we are part of the historic 1%!

The beautiful thing is that these won't be irrelevant. They are fantastic! I've been listening for months, eventually I'll make it through. I've listened to like five today alone.

Thanks again sir.

Very interesting episode, as always.  One has to wonder, what would history have been like if Caesar had been allowed to continue his career?  Would he have been able to conque Parthia and Germany?  I think probably Parthia, but Germany would have been a much bigger gamble.  And I'm not sure Rome would have been able to hold onto them after his death.

That being said, I imagine his assasination was kind of inevitable in a way.  It doesn't sound like his popularity was so great, or feelings for the republic so weak at that point, that Rome could have been transformed to an empire during the life of a single man.  And he would have never tolerated exile.

I have to disagree with John M. I don't think that Caesar's assassination was inevitable nor do I think that Caesar's popularity was very low.  I believe, and I think Mike will back me up in the next episode, that his popularity was great enough not only to allow Antony to orchestrate a backlash against the assassins but also to allow Octavian's rise to power, which was predicated on the strength of Caesar's name.
Discontent, even continued military resistance were both probably inevitable but outright assassination?  That was over the line.

I've wondered why we don't call Julius Caesar the first Emperor of Rome?  Didn't he sort of satisfy the requirements of the genre, and in fact, define the genre?  Is it only because his success was so short-lived?

@ John M and Jim,

Yes, I will back Jim up on this- I think "inevitable" is too strong a word (though I do think an attempt at some point was likely). Despite the hatred Caesar had fostered within the old nobility, he remained very popular with the lower and middle classes. When the Liberators announced that they had freed the city from Caesar's tyranny they were basically greeted with blank stares from the masses. Brutus et al had completely miscalculated the desire of the average Roman to go back to the old ways. I will go into this more this week for sure.

@ James,

While Caesar was *basically* an Emperor, we don't call him the "First Emperor of Rome" because there was still a lot of power out there he had not yet gobbled up (I think the big piece of fruit left hanging on the tree was the power of the Tribunate, which Augustus co-opted when he became the first true "Emperor"). I think, yes, if he had lived longer he probably would have gotten there, but when you look at the power Caesar had vs the power Augustus had, there is really no comparison. Caesar was a Dictator. Augustus was an EMPEROR.

Seems to me too that for Caesar, "Emperor" is a cute little dress-up costume when compared to Augustus. Is it too bold to say that no one since (and very few before) led a 'civilized' nation with as much direct authority as Augustus?

Great podcast and excellent insights. You're the subject of my blog today; both of my readers who also happen to not be my dog will probably be stopping by!

Let me explain the Mithridates to those people who might be confused.

At the beginning (about 30 seconds in) of episode 33 (Marius and Sulla) Mike referred to Mithridates IV (4) when he should have referred to Mithridates VI (6), who is also known as Mithridates the Great.

But when he corrected the error during this episode he said that he referred to Mithridates the Great as Mithridates VI rather then Mithridates IV, which, to me, sounds like an incorrect recounting of the error. (?)

If people want to read abit more about Mithridates VI I'll post a link below.

Wonder if anyone watched the Rome series on HBO, particularly the assassination. It's mostly inaccurate, including the location and some of the plotting (Marcus is shown being distracted away from Caesar outside, rather than trying to get to the place) but the assassination itself seemed pretty realistic to me... hard to watch, though.

Just a quick question, (discovered the podcast a month ago and really enjoying it).  Either in this episode or the one before you mentioned Cesar conducted a census in Rome and reallocated land in the provinces, cut grain quotas as a result.  I was just wondering if anyone had a reference to the source material for this, it's something I hadn't heard of before.  Regards and thanks,  Will

A very late aside: in an earlier episode, you mentioned that since the curia had been burned down by the mobs and the new one was being built, the Senate was meeting elsewhere.  (In the Theater of Pompey, in fact.)  This is therefore where Caesar was assassinated.  All true.  But you also said that people, sadly, cannot see the spot where this happened.  Not true!  The location where Caesar was assassinated has been excavated.  It's in the Largo Argentina in Rome, in the middle of a busy intersection (more or less).  The area is about 20 feet below street level today, so you can look down at remains of temples and other buildings.  And cats.  Lots and lots of cats.  Seriously, there's a cat rescue down there.  There's something about a cat napping on a Roman ruin that says more about the human greatness and time than Shelley ever did.

Anyway, I recommend it as a must-see on any visit to Rome.

I do have one question, though. Why did Caesar leave Antony in charge of Rome? I'm guessing Caesar knew about his Master of Horse's less than virtuous life style, but still.

Not a comment about any particular episode but a request. First. This podcast is excellent and with the hiatus recently i went back over many of the earlier episodes. I probably like many people had a limited, hollywood view of Roman history and this series has certainly opened my eyes to the great depth that was the empire. Thanks Mike.

OK now the request. You did one episode about Christmas / Saturnalia etc. and this was a small window into the Romans as a social people. SOme other bits people through about their tenaciousness in the face of adversity and their pride. If possible i would be interested in one or more episodes about the social and cultural life of the Romans. For instance i understand that in the time of Augustus a lot of time was spent visiting superiors etc. to greet them. THen of course is the institution of the baths, which again i believe was little in a sense with washing and all about socializing.

Now presumably my request would be no small task as the span of over a 1,000 years is a lot to cover and must have changed dramatically over that period but well if you get bored at any time.

Great podcast enjoy it very much.  I just listend to the March 1st episode and heard an error.  On the adoption of the 365 day calendar with a leap day added every 4 years by Julius  Ceaser they made a mistake.  It seems the Romans counted differently and added the extra day every 3 years for a couple of decades and had to remove the addition of several leap days to get it back on track.
Keep up the good work, the podcast is very entertaining.

Having only discovered THoR a few weeks ago, I zealously mowed through all fifty some-odd episodes. All other podcasts and radio broadcast were put on hold. Alas, now I am caught up forced to wait like any other poor pleb waiting for the next shipment of grain.

Mike, we are in you debt. Thank you.

And for you other Roman history buffs, might I recommend Stephan Dando-Collins' Caesar's Legion: The Epic Saga of Caesar's Tenth Legion and the Armies of Rome. The audio book is absolutely intoxicating.

Great work Mike, I have been following from almost the start and am a devotee.  I particularly like listening to these podcasts and then comparing them where possible with 'The Classical World' by Robin Lane Fox.  The latter episodes re Caesar & Co provide interesting perspectives in both cases.  Good luck for the remaining eps and best wishes to the patient soon to be Mrs THoR.

Your podcasts are great. As a child I used to love 'Asterix the Gaul' comic books and I'm now I'm a big fan of 'Rome' the HBO series. So listening to your podcasts is really enjoyable.

I have finally caught up to your latest one and now I can't imagine the agonizing wait for a new podcast to be posted. I'm already worried about what I'll listen to when the History of Rome comes to an end.

In one of your podcasts, could you go over the early history of Romulus and Remus in more detail?

Hi Mr. Duncan,
I joined late in the journey and have been feverishly catching up.  I had one question though.  During an earlier episode, you had discussed the Roman habit of careful logistics rather than the emphasis on individual tactics as a means to success in battle.  It seems that Julius Caesar violated that rule with regularity.  Was this isolated, or was there a shift in the proceeding Generals and Emperors focus (foci?).

Thanks for a great podcast!

I just discovered your podcast. Such a different perspective than the norm--and so refreshing. 'Once you take away their ships, pirates are just dudes who haven't bathed in a long time' made my day.

I'm sure you've seen the Garrett Fagan series by The Teaching Company. Your recital is the equal if not the better in many ways, with the exception of the Tiberius Gracchus episode, which benefited from a bit more drama in the Fagan version. I far prefer your telling of nearly everything else, and that's saying something because I think Fagan is one of the best lecturers around.

Great work. I'm hooked! My iPhone spiels out the story of Rome all the way to and from work every day.

So are you going to just keep combining podcasts as we go along to avoid hitting 50?

Is there no easier podcast hosting service!

I'm a Roman history buff and enjoy your stuff.  Missed it when it wasn't available.  However, I think you err on the conservative/senatorial side of the history.  Have you read Michael Parenti's "The Assassination of Julius Caesar"?  Keep up the good work.  DGB

Mike,

In case you didn't already know about this, but the RSS feed can only handle 50 podcasts(apperently). And since there are now 53 episodes this means that the first 3 (1,2 and 3a) aren't in the rss feed or showing up on iTunes.

Thought I'd tell you about it.

Best Wishes,

Mike,

I love the podcast - I look forward to every new episode.  Since this episode began with a question, here is one from me: How did the 'great' men of Rome build armies?  Especially those who were outside of the city or the Italian penisula?  As I listened to recent episodes, I kept thinking about how did they raise these armies?  I understand mercenaries (1,000 Gallic calvary) but you can't win with mercenaries only - just ask Carthage!

Thanks

Great show.  I finally caught up 2 weeks ago, though i'm still reviewing most of the episodes since it takes more than one listen to really master the material.  The writing in particular is excellent.  Its the best i've heard from any podcast; and i've listened to quite a few, albeit most of them are talk shows, but amongst them is 12 rulers.

In regards to Julius Ceasar being selfish, he probably was.  But perhaps there was also an ends justifies the means rationale to his crossing the Rubicon.  Perhaps he managed to convince himself that his planned reforms were worth tens of thousands of lives.  Even if so however, I think it is undeniable that he, and for that matter most Ancients, had less regard for human life than we do.  Ceasar in particular afterall committed genocide against Gallic peoples.  Given Ceasar's merciful treatment of his Roman enemies and his regard for the poor, perhaps, like say Thomas Jefferson, Julius Ceasar was civilized for his time (at least by our moral standards as opposed to those of Cato) but barbaric relative to leaders of most modern nations.

oooh! I loved Jared Croft's review:

"perhaps there was also an ends justifies the means rationale to his crossing the Rubicon."

Exactly! Demoncrats believe exactly that! That The End Justifies Any Means.

While, Republicans belive that the End is really only justified by The Means!

Demoncrats today are the National Socialists of tomorrow, while the Stahl-Helms of the German Republic stood by in amazement of a popular, tho Lethal Leader (Fuhrer) Hitler, (Messiah..Obama?).

Someone once said, "History repeats itself? No, it only echoes..."

I argue, that the Demoncrats are our own neuveu 'Hitler-Youth', 'Brown-Shirts'...while 'The Olde Guarde'...'The Doles', 'The McCains' become The Olde Rebublic...I.E. The Last Democracy.

Obama is our Clodius. FREE GRAIN! :)

Bush is our General Paul Von Hindenburg (he welcomed Hitler) Bush Welcomed Obama...

Welcome To 'The Decline and The Fall of The American Empire' :)

We shall need a new PodCast.

Title? 'The Rise and Fall of The American Empire', a mere 70 years.

What is Mike in Houston TX talking about? Is there a logical arguement in there??

"While, Republicans belive that the End is really only justified by The Means!" ??WTF??? Is that like the end of getting into an unwinnable war in Iraq is justified by the means of lying to Congress and the United Statesian people about the presence of WMD's and Saddam's "links" to Alqueda so that a select few of Bush's cronies (eg Rummy and Darth Cheny) could get ridiculously rich??? or is it the end of "preserving freedom" justified by the Means of extra-judicial renditions and the torturing of innocents (eg Mahar Arar)???

"Demoncrats today are the National Socialists of tomorrow"???again W-T-F??? I'm not really a big fan of the Demo's( After all for all the promises of change Obama's still the CEO, ooops sorry, "President" of the United Corporations, oooops sorry again "States" of America) The Republicans under Bush (and probably under whoever comes next) are waaaaaay more like the National Socialists then the Demo's with all their subversion of Democracy (eg Bush's first win  by vote rigging in Florida), stifling of dissent (eg look what happened to the Dixie Chicks who had the good sense to oppose the war in Iraq from the get go, unlike a lot of Demo's), the land/oil grab in Iraq/Czechoslovakia, and the whole "you're either with us or against us" crap.

As for the McCains being like Cato and the other defenders of "The Olde Rebublic", sure that makes some sense since McCain and the other Rebulicans are trying to maintain the power of the ruling oligarchy......which by this point in the story wasn't really a Democracy any more (go back and listen to what happened to the Gracchi brothers and compare it to what happened to X, King and the Kennedy brothers). Cato/McCain and their crews aren't as intrested in saving "The Last Democracy" as they were/are into preserving their privilaged places in their respective societies. Hopefully the Republican elite will get the same "reward" that Cato did.

For "'The Decline and The Fall of The American Empire' :)" , well, as a citizen of one of the other two countries in North America (and yes United Statesians there are TWO other countries in North Anmerica) I can always hope that this prediction comes true, and quickly, but I'm still skeptical that it will actually happen (I think it would have happened quicker if McCain had beat Obama, which is why I was rooting for him, as another unwinnable war in Iran would have helped to sped things up and further alienated the U.S. on the world stage. Now with Obama in, people might actually begin to believe that the U.S. is a force for "good" in the world again)

Finally Michael In Houston TX nothing smells as bad as a sore loser, and your boys (the Republicans) lost because they got less votes, so suck it up, that's "Democracy".

Mike I just wanted to tell you how much I apriciate you podcasts. I hope you continue soon.

To J.C.

 As German who has lived in America I have to strongly disagree with you. The ends justify the means can not be attributed to one particular party, but is I believe applicable to many political activities. Of cause seldom as radical as Caesar or Hitler. How often do the politicians make false promises in order to get voted?

I remember that it was Trueman, a Republican, who decided to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Of cause Perl Harbor was a horrible occurrence, but it was a military base unlike Hiroshima. The atomic bomb has affected people even today.

http://www.solarstorms.org/Hiroshima.htm

Are those the actions of a men who values freedom and the rights of others. I will not even get started on the era of Bush, because I would have to go into an hour long rant on how he practicaly
steeped all over the Constitution with his Patriot Act. It is not worth the paper it is written on.

Of cause there are also Democrats who do not have a white vest like Clinton and that Democratic senator who tried to sell his senators seat on e bay. Gos save us all To put it in the words of Obi wan Kenobi They are politicians and not to be trusted. To often they serve only their own agenda and not that of the people.

But honestly imagine Sarah Palin in office. I believe America would be domed. She is a ultra conservative who would wreck the image of the US in the world even further. Lets face it, McCain is already old and would not survive his first year in office and than we would have been be stuck with Palin for the rest of the term.

Teddy and his cousin FDR intruded many social reforms and neither of them were socialist nor were they the next Hitler. As German I find this comparison more than offencive. Although I can see why Obama's popularity might cause some reservations especially in the light of the recent crisis. Quite honestly I myself am socked how much expectations people put in the poor man. I do not believe he can fulfill all the hopes people put in him.

I am sorry I descended into a rant. If want respond you can reach me at my E mail under save_canon@yahoo.com, so we do not spam the boards.

ours truly

Great series Mike. I hope for our sakes the history channel doesn't steal you away from us before the conclusion of THoR. It seems that
Julius perfected political demagoguery. He said all things to all people as it suited his rise to power. The modern day parallels that are partially fueled by a glut of media outlets all competing to target
 audiences are obvious. Did not Ceasar, actually pay off his legions when he decided to march on Rome by giving them his share of booty and spoils from his final campaigns in Gaul, thereby purchasing their loyalty in a calculated manner?

I agree that the ends don't justify the means, ever
I am not a fan of the Democrats or Republicans (Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber)
Yes Bush sucked
Yes politicians are often liars/motivated solely by self interest no matter what political stripe

It is kind of interesting to be the only 8th grader at my school who knows anything about Rome that doesn't have to do with Julius Cesar. I don't know anyone else who knows who Scipio Africanus is.
Thanks for making the podcasts, and continue to make more.

It's just so cliche to make overly simplistic comparisons between history and today as if the former repeats itself. Everytime someone mentions nazis in a political discussion/argument, Thor kills a unicorn.

Mike,

I just want to say how much I am enjoying the History of Rome.  I came in halfway through and started with Caesar and I'm now up to Hadrian.  My favourite episodes are the ones dealing with the year of the four emperors, where I think you convey very well the chaos of those times.  Imagine being caught up in something like that and having to try to choose the winning side!  And what comes across so well overall is the nature of a political system in which ambitious men had to risk their lives for ambition -- so hard for us to imagine today.  I'm going to go back to your archive and pick up the earlier episodes.

Have you read the two novels by Robert Harris, Imperium and Lustrum, based on the life of Cicero?  The portrayal of Caesar is very compelling!

Best regards,

David Scarboro

Just another "I really appreciate your hard work!" post. I have really enjoyed your work; I think I downloaded 1-28 and then kept up. Really missed you when you were gone. I've been really excited that you're back, especially since I more of an Imperial rather than a Republican fan (my real passion is for Byzantium).

In any case, your podcasts make the story of the Roman Empire into a really interesting story that I look forward to hearing. Thanks for the hard work.

Hi Mike,

Great program. I'm always excited to see new episodes posted.

In the last few episodes you've referred to how the past crimes of JC kept him from returning to Rome without either imperium or, in leu of that, an army. Could you work in a review of just what the accusations are and if they were common offenses for such personages in his era? Do you refer to bribery, Cato's brief imprisonment, the land bill vote's legality, the validation of Clodius' adoption, or other things? What sanction might JC have realistically faced had he returned to Rome a private citizen, imprisonment, exile, execution? If the last, how real was that possibility?

To what extent was JC getting special treatment, attributable to his political adversaries for political reasons, and to what extent were his actions sincerely beyond the pale as per Roman precedent? Also, can you talk a bit more about JC's unpopularity among the senate and, in general, the patricians? What were the political dynamics here? Is this mere zero sum politics between the people and the elite compounded by the elite's perception of JC as a class traitor? The comparison I'm drawing in my own head is to the opprobrium FDR earned from his fellow upper class Americans. His New Deal was a radical political departure on dubious constitutional grounds (i.e., the court packing affair) who's upper class opponents were embittered by FDR's class betrayal.

The thesis you seem to be leading up to is that it was JC's desire to have freedom from persecution that ultimately ended the Republic, unless that actually came with Augustus. Thus, it's important to understand what was really at stake for JC and how it came to be that these stakes were amassed.

sincerely
Iain

Hi Mike Duncan,

I found your podcast a few months ago and I've finally gotten to where you are in the story right now.

I love what you do and I can't wait to hear the next bit.

Do you think you will continue on and do the Holy Roman Empire next?

Your podcast is great! I really look forward to it and missed it when you were on break. Always interested in history, I took Latin in high school (years ago) and was always fascinated at the stories. Much of it is very relatable to our times today. Many lessons to learn. I love the humor and casual delivery. Keep up the great work.

I have been listening for a while and really missed those 5 months.  Welcome back.

Could you try to add a little technical detail whenever possible?  How many people were in the *** tribe.  How many Romans on each of the 80 or 800 ships?

It would help my mental image.

Hi Mike,

I - amongst many others I'm sure - are so glad you've returned.  How exciting to see that new 'cast' under our precious 'the history of rome' itunes link - never thought I would be so happy to see a blue button!

You'll find a small contribution to the cause - please buy a good Italian wine before your next recording - and something to add (although you've already past the early era...:

"Although wines had been elaborated from the wild Vitis vinifera grape for millennia, it wasn't until the Greek colonization that wine-making flourished. Viticulture was introduced into Sicily and southern Italy by the Mycenaean Greeks[3], and was well established when the extensive Greek colonization transpired around 800 BC.[4][5] It was during the Roman defeat of the Carthaginians (acknowledged masters of wine-making) in the second century BC that Italian wine production began to further flourish. Large-scale, slave-run plantations sprang up in many coastal areas and spread to such an extent that, in AD92, emperor Domitian was forced to destroy a great number of vinyards in order to free up fertile land for food production.
During this time, viticulture outside of Italy was prohibited under Roman law. Exports to the provinces were reciprocated in exchange for more slaves, especially from Gaul where trade was intense, according to Pliny, due to the inhabitants being besotted with Italian wine, drinking it unmixed and without restraint.[6] Roman wines contained more alcohol and were generally more powerful than modern fine wines. It was customary to mix wine with a good proportion of water which may otherwise have been unpalatable, making wine drinking a fundamental part of early Italian life."

I have been listening to you from episode nr. 03, and I must say this podcast is something else. I admit that I am an avid user of podcasts, but this one I have listened through from first to last episode at least 5 - 6 times by now. I love history, and podcasts/audio books are a fantastic way of turning tedious work (like rendering ink drawings and stuff....I am an illustrator/designer)in to a pure joy...
I know....I should have nipped by before, but....eeee   well...here I am now.
Thank you very much, and next time my pay check aloud it (I am an alone parent)I will kick some appreciation your way....it is well deserved.
Take care and keep'em coming.
Your soothing voice has more than once turned a dark day in to something bearable....once again thank you...

Hello Mike,

I've been enjoying your series a great deal since finding it on iTunes a couple of weeks ago. I can see by the other comments I've read here that you've met with virtually unanimous praise for your work. I would like to add my voice to the throng of admirers, with one small difference...
a minor criticism.

Your pronunciation of some of the names and terms needs a bit of work. I don't want to bore you with a complete list but as examples:
 'Vercingetorix' is pronounced with a hard G, not a soft one and apparently you haven't had much experience using the word,'Centurion'. I've never heard it pronounced with such a heavy emphasis on the last syllable. Please forgive me but I would have thought that someone so obviously interested in Roman history would show a more comfortable familiarity the language.
I would like to encourage you to spend some time listening to people actually speaking in reference to ancient Rome, rather than just reading it out of a book.HBO's Rome, is an excellent series which you must've already seen, but there are others as well.
Another roman drama series, I Claudius, was produced by the BBC in the seventies, based on the novel by Robert Graves. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. British Documentary series have also been very entertaining and informative, such as The Celts, which if memory serves, has a good section on Vercingetorix. Another would be Testament, by John Romer. This is a history of the Bible and has a facinating section on the early christians and there eventual dominance over the Roman empire; a must for any student of Roman history.

My only purpose here is a sincere desire to help. I would hope that a presenter of history such as yourself would want to project an air of knowledge and ease with the facts; not one of youthful ignorance and naivete'. I'm not accusing you of being the later, just encouraging you to be more like the former.
I hope you have found this criticism to be constructive and I wish you the best of luck in your continuation of this fine and excellent series.

Well done.

Here is a quote from Momsens History of Rome.
This is the reason why Caesar is justly famous. His impact on the shape of the modern world cannot be underestimated.
Taken from  The Project Gutenberg eBook

"But the fact that this great people was ruined by the Transalpine wars
of Caesar, was not the most important result of that grand enterprise;
far more momentous than the negative was the positive result.
It hardly admits of a doubt that, if the rule of the senate
had prolonged its semblance of life for some generations
longer, the migration of peoples, as it is called, would have
occurred four hundred years sooner than it did, and would have
occurred at a time when the Italian civilization had not become
naturalized either in Gaul, or on the Danube, or in Africa and
Spain.  Inasmuch as the great general and statesman of Rome
with sure glance perceived in the German tribes the rival antagonists
of the Romano-Greek world; inasmuch as with firm hand he established
the new system of aggressive defence down even to its details,
and taught men to protect the frontiers of the empire by rivers
or artificial ramparts, to colonize the nearest barbarian tribes along
the frontier with the view of warding off the more remote,
and to recruit the Roman army by enlistment from the enemy's country;
he gained for the Hellenico-Italian culture the interval necessary
to civilize the west just as it had already civilized the east.
Ordinary men see the fruits of their action; the seed sown by men
of genius germinates slowly.  Centuries elapsed before men understood
that Alexander had not merely erected an ephemeral kingdom
in the east, but had carried Hellenism to Asia; centuries again
elapsed before men understood that Caesar had not merely conquered
a new province for the Romans, but had laid the foundation
for the Romanizing of the regions of the west.  It was only a late
posterity that perceived the meaning of those expeditions
to England and Germany, so inconsiderate in a military point of view,
and so barren of immediate result.  An immense circle of peoples,
whose existence and condition hitherto were known barely through
the reports--mingling some truth with much fiction--of the mariner
and the trader, was disclosed by this means to the Greek and Roman
world.  "Daily," it is said in a Roman writing of May 698,
"the letters and messages from Gaul are announcing names of peoples,
cantons, and regions hitherto unknown to us."  This enlargement
of the historical horizon by the expeditions of Caesar beyond
the Alps was as significant an event in the world's history
as the exploring of America by European bands.  To the narrow circle
of the Mediterranean states were added the peoples of central
and northern Europe, the dwellers on the Baltic and North seas;
to the old world was added a new one, which thenceforth was influenced
by the old and influenced it in turn.  What the Gothic Theodoric
afterwards succeeded in, came very near to being already carried
out by Ariovistus.  Had it so happened, our civilization would have
hardly stood in any more intimate relation to the Romano-Greek than
to the Indian and Assyrian culture.  That there is a bridge connecting
the past glory of Hellas and Rome with the prouder fabric of modern
history; that Western Europe is Romanic, and Germanic Europe
classic; that the names of Themistocles and Scipio have to us
a very different sound from those of Asoka and Salmanassar;
that Homer and Sophocles are not merely like the Vedas and Kalidasa
attractive to the literary botanist, but bloom for us in our own
garden--all this is the work of Caesar; and, while the creation
of his great predecessor in the east has been almost wholly reduced
to ruin by the tempests of the Middle Ages, the structure of Caesar
has outlasted those thousands of years which have changed religion
and polity for the human race and even shifted for it the centre
of civilization itself, and it stands erect for what we may
designate as eternity."
I would recommend it as good reading in parallel with THOR

and now the era of Caesar -- the main event as far as Roman History.  love him or hate him for his role in the death of the republic, but frankly the republic was already dead.  he just called the time of death. if only he had gotten the chance to take down the Parthians.

Mike,

I started listening to your podcast after it was posted on Metafilter a couple weeks ago (http://www.metafilter.com/77925/All-podcasts-lead-to-Rome). I started from the beginning and just caught up. It has been a joy to listen to and I hope you keep up the good work. I have learned so much! I particularly like how you make every detail relevant to the overall story of Rome. Thank you!

All excellent stuff. Most enjoyable.
But "and ending (someday) with the exile of Romulus Augustulus, last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire"??!.
You do plan to go on, don't you? (1453 ...)

Woot! Now I can start using the actors from "Rome" when I picture people! :P

Also, I've been listening to older podcasts and must comment on how much better you're getting at this thing. Not that the old ones are bad or anything, you just have really mastered how to make a THoR episode.

Hey.  Great podcast.  I've been listening for a while and really enjoy it.  I actually picked it up after Brownworth's "12 Byzantine Rulers" finished.  I hadn't realized the golden years of Roman Republic were so turbulent.  Can't wait to hear more as you get into the Roman Empire.

The thing I've often wondered about the Roman Empire, and maybe this is just a misunderstanding on my part, is why was the Succession line not more direct along father-son lines.  Vespasian to Titus/Domitian and Marcus Aurelius to Commodus being the few instances of father to son that I know of prior to Constantinian Dynasty.  Any particular reason for that, or just a lack of sons?

Mike,

Despite the breakdown of the republican order, Roman antipathy toward any hint of monarchy lived on. The Romans were highly suspicious of father to natural son succession so the norm became adoption of a successor once a suitable candidate was found. This worked particularly well during the reign of the 5 Good Emperors when the candidates were all chosen for merit rather than kinship.

Or, maybe this had something to do with it...

Natural sons alive at time of Emperor's death:

Augustus- None
Tiberius- None
Caligula- None, plus he was assassinated
Claudius- one young son who would be passed over in favor of Nero (who then had the boy murdered)
Nero- None, plus he was assassinated
Year of Four Emperors- coup upon countercoup
Vespasian- Titus and Domitian
Titus- None
Domitian- None, plus he was assassinated
Nerva- None
Trajan- None
Hadrian- None
Antonius Pius- None
Marcus Aurelius- Joaquin Phoenix
Joaquin Phoenix- The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire

You make the call.

Thanks for the reply.  I hadn't realized so few had children, let alone alive children by the time they died.  There's still hope for Joaquin.  I mean, now that he's in a band I'm sure having many children will soon follow.  The Empire may rise again.

I'm really having trouble hearing your voice on this one. I listen to podcasts in the car using an FM transmitter, and sometimes I get static. Your podcast has always been lower in volume than most of the ones I listen to, but this week I couldn't even listen to until I got home. Can you record the next one a little louder?

Thanks again for putting this podcast out... I'm a huge fan.

Great podcast! I discovered it about a week ago and I am already caught up. Thanks for doing it each week. I have one request though. Would it be possible for you to do an episode that explains what life was like for an average Roman living in Rome? I'm sure its not that simple. Even if you can just take a portion of an episode shed a bit of light on life in Rome. That would be great! Thanks, again for a great podcast!

I agree with jrbooth. I love the biographical and military stuff, but a little bit on daily life and what Rome was physically like would allow us to picture it all. Stone buildings or wood? Central-heating? What were the banquets like at this point?
It's also important as we and the Romans themselves kept coming back to the idea of decadence and how increasing luxury destroyed the moral life of Rome.

Meh, historians concentrate on military and political history because that's the interesting stuff. You can find historians specializing in the lifestyle of people in certain times, however, I find it extremely difficult to pay attention to such subjects.

"Stone buildings or wood?"

Well, Augustus is reported to have said "I found Rome a city of wood and left her a city of marble.", so that would indicate that Rome of the Republican period was largely made of wood. However, that's kind of shaky evidence.

"Central-heating?"

"What were the banquets like at this point? "

...feasty?

I truly hope you continue this series.  I have encouraged all my friends and family to listen.  I find your approach enjoyable and entertaining and the information you provide worthwhile beyond compare.  My only hope is that my friends and family gain from your podcast the prospectus many of students of Rome have when we watch the events happen today.  I truly hope an audio company out there get wind of this podcast and seeks to make it not only a labor of love for you but a labor of profit as well.

Just wanted to say thanks for firing up the podcast again... it's one of the best!

Would it be possible for you to list some of your sources or maybe just a list of books about Rome you like?  I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like to delve a little deeper into some aspects of the narrative.

Thanks again!

I really enjoy listening to your podcast! You do an excellent job with your research and an excellent job compiling that into an engaging narrative!

I was still catching up with episodes during your short hiatus so, to me, there was no interruption!  :-)

And finally, a question: would you consider continuing on with the History of Rome past the exile of Romulus Augustulus? Because the story of the Roman Empire truly did not end until Constantinople fell in 1453.

Either way, I truly enjoy listening and will save them all for "re-listening" in the future!

Larry-

It's waaaay too early to start thinking about what happens after Romulus Augustulus. We're not even to Caesar Augustus yet!

FWIW though, I would probably continue the story of Rome itself through the barbarian riddled Dark Ages rather than hop over to the Byzantines. But honestly, I think I'll probably draw the line at 476. All good things must come to an end...

It may interest you to know that the fans have created a Facebook group on your behalf. Perhaps a shameless plug is in order so that the group can grow and we can amuse ourselves in between episodes.

I am so glad you have come back. Hearing your voice again feels so good. Throughout our long separation all I did was think about you coming back! There were times, though, when I was so lonely without you. I know it might hurt to tell you this but...I was unfaithful: I listened to many episodes of The Napoleon Podcast. I know the fact that after each time I was left wanting does not make it any easier. I just hope you can understand how needy I was and that you will believe me when I say it meant nothing. I feel it is important to continue on by starting with honesty. I am so glad you are back!

Mike,

The last three epidodes seem to have some background hiss, which the episodes you recorded before your hiatus didn't have. I can hear the hiss both whilst listening on my mp3 and on PC. But I am curious if anyone else has noticed this, or if it's just me?

Best Wishes,

Just discovered your podcast tonight over on podcastalley.com, and just this minute finished listening to the first episode.  Wanted to say, "Thank you," and "Great Job!"  Lots of neat stuff I never knew ("Why was the ROMAN language called LATIN, daddy?" "Dunno. Shut up and get me a beer!")

Looking forward to hundreds of more years of Roman rise and fall.

But you definitely gotta know your excellent work has created junkies. Blessings. I'll be passing along your work for years. PLEASE consider putting in a few episodes at the end to deliver your interpretations on how the history you've covered is reflected in later history. No joke homie, I've passed along .mp3 to at risk youth. Hope you are enjoying a golden age.

Great, great, podcast.  I love the orgniazation and pacing.  Can you do something addressing the historical errors in popular media treatment of the Julius Caesar timeline?  Shakespeare and HBO took a lot of poetic license with Brutus, Mark Antony and the lot.  Also, while I like the chronological approach, theme episodes, like the Christmas episode last year, are a nice too.  Keep it going.

@Michael in Houston: Oh my holy goodness! That looks mostly right, though I can see you have some 2's where there should be 1's down around Tiberius Gracchus.  I have a plan to produce a THoR specific timeline, but until then please see Jim in Portland's helpful links.

Thanks for bringing back my absolute favourite podcast.

I'm going to have to revisit a few earlier episodes to get back into the swing of things.... no hardship at all.

So glad to see the History of Rome is back. Really enjoyed episode 34 and I'm downloading episode 35 now. I'm mentioning the return of tHoR on my own podcast, as I think this is the best history podcast not coming out of the BBC (In Our Time remains my favourite).

Cheers and thanks for all your work!

Do you have a podcast released sometime in Nov 2008 that compared the then current situation to a similar situation endured by the Roman Empire?  I heard a piece on NPR that I would like to use in my history classes.  Just wondering if it was something you produced.

There is a fairly recent book titled "Empires of Trust" (can't recall the author), that quite thoroughly explores this comparison.

Has THOR read Michael Parenti's Assassination of Julius Caesar for a different take on the oft-criticized behaviour of the mob and social-reformers-dubbed-demagogues like the Gracchi? I would like to hear more - although there already is some - commentary from THOR on the issue of exploitation by the senatorial class of the general populace as well as the social issue of patronage and personal honour that seems to run right through Roman history and explain so many otherwise unaccountably selfish and immoral decisions.

So, I am a Greek history buff, one, in my area, nearly matching the maker of this podcast in his. Because of this I decided to take  a job that would allow me to be as close as possible to Greece. Teaching English. I couldn't find work in Greece itself however and am now living in manisa, turkey. Which is themodern name for magnessia. As it seems I have ended up about a mile from the place where the Greeks effectively lost their aura of preeminance in the ancient world. Strange irony eh? Looking to walk in their glory and end up living near their effective defeat.
Love your podcast by the way. Maybe I'll try my luck at a History of Greece.

Mike,

Man, I have to tell you that I love your show.  Just discover it this week.  I have 1 question for you.  Did Hannibal and Scipio really meet face to face?  I have not pick up to many books, but I thought the two men never meet face to face.  What reference did this information come from?

Your description of Seleucid armies is really terrible. I love your podcast, but don't be so Roman centric. It wasn't some Syrian armies of pathetic levies, it was army of Seleucid Empire, with contingents from Asia Minor to eastern Iran, with war elephants, cataphracts and elite phalangitai. Obviously Roman army proved superior, but outcome of this war was far from foregone conclusion.

Just to let you know you are mispronouncing Hannibal Barca's surname.  It is a little point, but annoying none the less.  The name is pronounced Bar ka, not Baraka.

for me I am more into hannibal and his conquering battles like trebia,trasimene, and cannae. So i was wondering if you had different lectures on that instead?

I'm really enjoying the podcast. But one thing's bugging me. There are only two a's in BARCA. Hannibal and Hamilcar's last name is "Barca" and not "Baraca!"

That's why today we have the beautiful city of "Barcelona", not "Baracelona". :)

Just one small nitpick on an otherwise enjoyable podcast.

I tried to access the podcast and could not. When trying to open the podcast in a new tab, I got the following message:

Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /1780001306481/MikeDuncan-22PreludeToTheSecondPunicWar775.mp3 on this server.

Any chance you could fix this?

I've only just found your podcast, and must say in the first two episodes, I've found it so interesting. I'm no student, nor professor, just an interested history 'buff'. To listen to this podcast (#2) struck a chord with my knowledge of Australian history (I'm an Aussie). When the first fleet settled in Australia, just as the first Romans, they were lacking an important commodity to survival, FEMALES. The then Governor, sent a request for women to be sent, and they were... The equivalent of those men first transported, criminals and such. While many of their crimes were trivial, especially by today's standards, the seeds of one of the greatest countries in the world were sown by criminals and vagabonds... :)

I look forward to learning much more of Rome in the time to come..

And of course I can't help thinking of our American "Lady Liberty":
"Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
The Mother of Exiles

What on Earth is an "indiscration"?  You don't have a spellchecker?  A misspelling this atrocious sort of calls into question this entire podcast series.  For crying out loud, it is almost 4 years old and you still haven't corrected it!

Oh my Ed. Your comment speaks much more about yourself and your outlook than it does of Mr. Duncan's work. Feel free to take the door right over there, or perhaps you might take a moment to wonder why and listen on. It is your choice.
Mike's work stands proudly. He never made claims of perfection and you will find a lot of opportunities in the world for criticism.
THoR podcast won legions of fans around the world including many very well educated people with good reason. It has spawned online groups and an actual THoR tour of the sites.
Much Luck with your hobbies.

I did just come back to start listening again...
Thanks for your time and dedication Mike:)

Val-indeed it does say something about it me.  It shows that I care about fundamentals such as correct spelling.  This sort of thing would have been caught by any semi-qualified editor.  I think it speaks volumes about the author's methods that he couldn't even be bothered to use a bloody spellchecker!

This podcast is rubbish.  The reason that it is so popular is that people cannot be bothered to read a book.  There is no information or perspective in this podcast that couldn't be obtained from a quality book.  In fact, I suspect that "Mr. Duncan" paraphrased this entire series from books, or, or likely, websites.  I'd wager just about anything that he did absolutely no original research nor did he examine any primary sources of Roman history at length.  I also seriously doubt that he knows Latin.  No intelligent person would consider the opinion of someone lacking Latin as any sort of authority regarding Roman history.  What you fanboys such as yourself like is the fact that Mr. Duncan has spared you the onerous chore of cracking a book.

In my opinion fewer people listen to this podcast than statistics revel, and even fewer read these comments. So I doubt these anonymous bytes of data will ever shatter the destinies of mankind.

Ed- You are a small and ingsinificant man to denigrate the entire piece of work due to a spelling mistake. If you are such an expert in the field where is your work in the area? of course there is none, just happy to criticise from the outside without actually doing anything yourself


btw i spelt insignificant wrong just to annoy you even more

@Jon,you do realize that the "work" for the podcast is probably nothing more than a paraphrase of Wikipedia articles?  I stand by my contention that the podcast contained no original research, and that the man responsible for it quotes from primary sources only when they were found in a secondary (or tertiary, etc,) sources (despite the [You can criticize the quality of the show all you want, but please do not call me a liar-- Thanks, Mike].  I would love to see a text of the show, complete with specific citations for proof to the contrary.  Indeed, if this work is so great, how come the text of the contents hasn't been collected and published as a history book?

No, I don't purport to be an "expert" on Roman history, but neither do I put websites into my own words via paraphrase and try to pass it off as some sort of achievement or act as if doing so makes me someone who can speak about the topic with authority.

Granted, the podcast isn't bad if you take it for what it is-some dude summarizing Wikipedia in his own words with occasional attempts at puns.  One would be much better off for simply reading a good one volume book on the matter like "History of Rome" by Michael Grant.  Of course, reading the primary sources would be best, but if you don't have the time to read one book, you probably don't have the time to read *many*, so a good one like Grant's will do. But I suspect that the appeal of the podcast is mainly for people who are to lazy to do much reading at all.

In short, no one should consider an audio recording of a rewording of an internet encyclopedia as some sort of accomplishment.

@Mike, to be fair to both me and you, I cannot say that I called you a liar, because, to the best of my knowledge, I have not seen an explicit statement to the effect of "this podcast has been written based on source X" or "this factoid comes from source Y".

However, the presence of a bibliography implies the the contents derive the works therein contained.  Be that as it might, I refuse to believe that the contents of the podcast are not, with possibly a few minor exceptions, the paraphrases of Wikipedia articles on Roman history, and perhaps other websites.  I would  gladly and fully retract this statement were the contents somehow sourced/cited.

Further, I am not criticizing in any way the quality of the show, per se.  In terms of reading modified text from of internet site(s), I guess the quality is more or less reasonable.  What I do find fault with is the fact that fanboys see the podcast as something beyond what it is; an audio paraphrase of Wikipedia.  It bothers me in no way that people would enjoy this podcast-but problem is that far too many are saying that it is something that it isn't.

Even a relatively short book that perhaps condenses Roman history a wee bit too much, like Grants "History of Rome" that I mentioned earlier, would have been a serious investment intellectual effort, selecting and reading the sources in Latin and Greek, etc, not to mention time consuming.  It's the product of serious and thoughtful scholarship.  This podcast, on the other hand, consists of simply restating the words of an internet encyclopedia.  Again, there's nothing wrong with that, in and of itself-just say so instead of hinting that it mostly comes from Classical sources or even books by contemporary historians.  Unless you're independently wealthy with no need to work and thus have a ton of free time, or you are some sort of super speed reader, there is no way you could have read more than a fraction of the bibliography, anyway.

The first episode. To think that you would complete this monumental task of covering the entire Ancient Roman history in under 5 years time. That is roughly 250 years covered per year. Pretty good when you consider the depth of the work throughout. There is nary an event of import that he did not cover in detail.

In the end I really think this will go down as a modern day Gibbon. I really believe that.

Mike, has a gift for this. The sheer amount of research that went into any given episode is astounding. Especially given that much of the time he was pumping out an episode per week.

I cannot wait for his new project now that what was started here is now completed.
