<!--<p>Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome…</p>-->

<p>I published the first episode of The History of Rome podcast on July 27, 2007 and then released episodes weekly for the next five years. I published 189th and final episode on May 6, 2012. Though the show is now complete, The History of Rome remains one of the most popular and influential history podcasts in the history of history podcasting. Here you will find the complete archives of the show as well as links and information about my current projects. When you are done with The History of Rome, come join us for my current series, Revolutions, which explores the great political revolutions of the Modern Age and has been ongoing since 2013.</p>

<p>SPQR, <br />Mike</p>

<!--<p>PS And, of course, I hope you pick up a copy of <i>The Storm Before The Storm: The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic</i> (Oct 2017 PublicAffairs). It’s good and you’ll like it!</p>-->
