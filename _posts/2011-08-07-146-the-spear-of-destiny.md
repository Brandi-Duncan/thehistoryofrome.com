_Update: OK, wow, passing along the recommendation for_ 1421: The Year China Discovered the World _was a huge blunder. I have re-recorded the ad to correct the mistake. The embedded link reflects the newer version, so if you want to forget this grizzly business, just erase the episode you have and replace it with the one linked to above._

_The new ad script:_

_"This week I initially passed along a listener recommendation for_ 1421: The Year China Discovered the World. _However, I must confess that I did not do my usual due diligence on researching the merits of the book and so am just now discovering that_ 1421 _is basically pseudo-historical nonsense that relies on no good evidence whatsoever, speculates wildly beyond the facts and that the author Gavin Menzies is basically a novelist pretending to be a historian. I am embarrassed to have given_ 1421 _The History of Romebs seal-of-approval, it is not good history, and I sincerely apologize for what can only be described as a sloppy recommendation. How about next time I just recommend_ The History of the World in 100 Objects _or maybe one of those_ Star Wars _books people keep wanting me to plug?"_

_Mea Culpa,_

_Mike_
