Between 58 and 63 AD Rome dealt with a major conflict over the Kingdom of Armenia and a revolt in Britain led by the warrior Queen Boudica.

_[Update]: You know the part where I'm talking about the Romans being marched out under the yoke? Alert listener Robert caught me referencing the Battle of the Colline Gate, when I should have referenced the Battle of the Caudine Forks. Sorry about that._ (_But in my defense, they do both start with a "C")_
